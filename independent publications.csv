AABF,Politics of sound #2 music that heals bodies and stories,"The theme Politics of Sound invites us to explore the role of music as a social and political force, an often overlooked yet incredibly powerful form of listening in our culture and society. Escaping the visible, music is capable of reflecting, perceiving, and hearing the world in a more accurate way, one that is hidden from view. To celebrate 2024, the journal Afrikadaa presents in its upcoming issue, Politics of Sound #2, a captivating archaeology of sounds and musical movements as impulses, rhythms, convulsions, riots, uprisings, fluctuations, and the pulse of social, political, and cultural transformations. This issue is committed to examining the multiplicity of musical currents that have marked the struggles for freedom, civil rights, and Pan-African movements. Through fictional narratives, the aim is to build bridges between an aesthetic history and a social and political history of sound and music, revealing their profound cultural and political influence and the interdependence of these influences. Here, music emerges as both the promise and the movement toward different worlds. In a decolonial listening context, it is understood as an act of resistance and cultural reappropriation. Music and sounds then become privileged spaces—both material and immaterial, past, present, future, and emerging—where marginalized voices can be expressed, where liberation can be imagined, and alternative narratives can take shape.",2025,,,Africa,Global South,https://africanartbookfair.com/produit/politics-of-sound-2-les-musiques-qui-reparent-les-corps-et-les-recits/
AABF,"AFRIKADAA 15 – Racism, Discrimination. Where do art schools stand?","The editorial space of AFRIKADAA has always been conceived as a refuge and a space of freedom. A place to show, transmit, speak, and propose freely. We truly believed this until the moment we created this issue. Until we confronted the institution of art schools in France. A system, as many accounts note, idyllic on the outside and pathetic on the inside. The title of this special issue is  Racism, Silence, Mobilization… Where Do Art Schools Stand? We never imagined that the silence demanded by art schools would be imposed on our contributors. Despite the importance of the work undertaken by the AFRIKADAA collective in creating this refuge, which has provided support for graduation, theoretical and bibliographical assistance, and more, and also serves as an additional platform for addressing issues related to the educational spaces of art schools; We found ourselves confronted with self-censorship. This led to silence, withdrawal, anonymity, or linguistic detours. Despite everything, we tried to work with this reality and offer here an introduction to a work in progress. To be perfectly honest with you, this pervasive observation impacted the entire team. During collaborative review meetings, how many of us had to pause in the face of a succession of testimonies recounting events that impacted the very core of our being, or find ourselves wondering what the point was of producing this issue if we couldn't derive any usefulness from it for students  or for any profound changes in art education settings ? The release and the  The feasibility of this issue was questioned many times, as was its scope. After these reflective exchanges, we decided to use all of this as the basis for our research for this issue. We envisioned this editorial scope as a possible and ideal school, which could be understood in four areas. The first concerns the faculty and the development of new teaching methods; the second, more focused on care and support, welcomes the voices of the students; A third section recounts the actions undertaken by art school administrations, in response to state requests to create new professorships related to decolonial and/or postcolonial studies, gender studies, and other fields, but also driven by a desire for more inclusive educational spaces. However, given that these proposals are still far from sufficient and impactful, we propose rewriting a more inclusive history with alternative spaces such as the augmented library project, a project we would like to implement following this issue, in collaboration with female students from several, if not all, art schools in France. Finally, a last section, described as transgressive, celebrates approaches that embrace the unconventional and self-directed learning. This issue, and therefore the nascent art school presented here, is far from perfect but should be understood as the first step in a process, as stated above, which we hope will be followed by concrete actions in art schools. But what we are sure of is that this editorial proposal will be found in all art schools in France and is a seed, moreover, from which actions, reflections and debates will emerge for a better future of art schools.",2023,,,Africa,Global South,https://africanartbookfair.com/produit/afrikadaa-15-racisme-discrimination-ou-en-sont-les-ecoles-dart-digital/
AABF,"AFRIKADAA 12 – The between-worlds, art as a weapon of healing","In response to a world that the economy has rendered unilaterally, we witness the emergence of many artistic practices that attempt to re-establish communication and exchange between here and beyond. These practices consult tools, insights, rites of ancestral heritage, and aim at renewing and extending the therapeutic possibilities of art. During the In Between World art project at La Colonie during the Night of Ideas, December 2017; the Afrikadaa collective and its invited artists, examined the healing power of art by exploring the artistic practices inherited from diaspora tradition. Unpacking these rituals and their reinterpretations – if not re-appropriation – in contemporary creation. In the current volume, the Afrikadaa review aims to bring attention to these creative practices in order to better understand what they teach us in face of relentless mutation of our contemporary world. These artistic practices seem to invite us to decentralized. For this reason liberating our imaginative capacity to conceive a common existence. In such manner, they propose a new humanity that might prove more hospitable and attentive to the organic release of history. In and of themselves, these manifestations open an In Between World, a new artistic cartography. An initiated collective space of experimentation, bearer of relationship’s poetics, immateriality and gestures. In Between World therefore expresses itself through the event of this coming volume as a fictional space, where the review considers itself as a body, receiving fragments of exploration, hesitations and questions – like a trembling body. It is therefore a catalyzer of change, where contemporary artists lift the veil that obscures our trauma, and one after the other exorcises a dilemma via artistic works. This review’s issue will be constructed as a space of reparation, where conflicting narratives will cohabit and where divers of non institutional artistic practices will confront each other. Here, tradition and modernity rethink themselves and these attributes find a space in a time of In Between World that only initiates illumination can illuminate. The review becomes a therapeutic space of initiation, offering prospective and constructive research. Intimate knowledge of the world and beyond reconciles the colonialized space. It cares for its broken narratives, its invisible wounds and its traumas. The In Between World is also seen, in this issue of the review, as a space of pacification, where poetry is challenged by other voices, both provocative and constraining. Healing sometimes demands a weapon – fire, a scalpel, a revolution. To heal through pain or through comfort ? It is a question that is at the crossroads of political, medical, metaphysical and artistic discourses. Either cut or sowed, either consumed poison or medicine; healing, in its most extreme carries a form of sabotage whose very weapon is its principal virtue. The universe of the In Between World is the last free field of experimentation, of true riches, for its the only space that remains unpolluted, uncolonized. It is difficult to access, and one can only enter through initiation. Appealing eternally to our traditions, in order to reposition them at the center of our thought and discourse, long banished to the intellectual periphery, discredited, yet capable of providing care for the sick bodies of modern cultural institutions, today. Confronting societies’ crises – its populisms, extremism, ever rising racism… The nurturing practices of the minority have long been rejected but now may play a key role in repairing fractured contemporary societies. This voyage into the In Between World is achieved through various artistic disciples, and the Afrikadaa review invites artists, researchers, curators, scholars, philosophers, writers, historians, musicians and activists to participate in interrogating our common being, activating other potentialities and redefining the possible. Thus allowing art to reveal itself a tool for healing and for emancipation.",2019,,,Africa,Global South,https://africanartbookfair.com/produit/afrikadaa-12/
AABF,AFRIKADAA 9 – Anthropologisms,"Today, many contemporary artists from the Southern worlds work with the (re) appropriation of anthropological patterns. They do so by subverting the clichés to divert them from their primitive destinations, using mimicry as a critique of the approach devised by those scientists from another time, or by using anthropological processes as material in their work. In many ways, the reference to anthropology is today, a recurring practice. Are this anthropologism and the stakes at play here, signing the death of anthropology ? A revival ? What use can be made of photographic archives ? Is anthropologism the mark of decolonization ? How do artists and scientists distinguish themselves from a system of knowledge deeply inscribed with a colonial and racial ideology ? What do they make of this heritage? How in the recycling of images from the past, does art assumes a role in social commentary? These questions highlight that the art / anthropology connection is a source of critical interrogations Simultaneously to these developments, anthropologists in general – and the so-called Africanists in particular – have taken hold of contemporary African art. Is this a logical continuation, from the primitive arts on which anthropology focused its attention on during the twentieth century ? Is this phenomenon limited to France ? What are its implications ? More broadly, what is the meaning of shows like The invention of the Savage or Exhibit B ? Can we separate these actions from the revival of old clichés? The anthropologisms seem characteristic of the early twenty-!rst century, and this is true whether we look at the encounters generated from art to anthropology (most notably, with artistic approaches also making claims to be theoretical research), or from anthropology to art. Which hybridizations do these encounters give place to ?",2015,,,Africa,Global South,https://africanartbookfair.com/produit/afrikadaa-9-digital/
AABF,AFRIKADAA 8 – Moving Image,"Drawing from perspectives of cultural heterogeneity and multiple temporalities, this issue of Afrikadaa focuses upon the moving image and its modes of narrative. Once found in movie theaters, and then in art galleries, today the moving image has become an integral part of our everyday experiences. The proliferation and broadening of its domain forces us to decompartamentalize discipines and their methodologies, so that we can rethink its narrative appartuses and imagistic regimes, and the ways in which this a ects how we see these images.  Starting with the idea of the moving image, Afrikadaa will foreground the convergence, and the processes of hybridization between, cinema, contemporary art and the media, all from the perspective of innovative narration. Or, to be more precise, we will consider artists who articulate new writings, or new cinematic language, and who then interrogate the spaces that result. Artists who multiply discursive and narrative forms, and who take possession of possibilities of transmission in order to conceive of, in formats and circuits distant from commercial cinema, other criteria of visibility. The scene-object is it obsolete? Is it dead for these avant-garde filmmakers? The storyline as it is presently known has no place in the cinema of the 21st century. We aim to interrogate the Archive as film-object together with the films and videos of contemporary artists and filmmakers who work in the context of colonial and post-colonial cultures and the currents that cross therein.  At a time when democratic expression has taken a new place of importance — even as it is threatened — artists de ne their scale of visibility, circulating words that move against the grain of a globalized, consensual culture and offer an identitary revindication situated in a geopolitical time and place. In this issue we include lms that give space to individual and collective speech, which assemble consensus and divergence in order to create di erent ways of thinking. But we do not shy away from interrogating these new practices and uses of the image via alternative lmic apparatuses. Like a laboratory in which diverse screens cohabitate, this experience pushes textual/imagistic narration to its limit, approaching the idea that cinema is reinventing reality. To make cinema is to materialize the real. In this issue we include the work of artists who reinvent and interrogate new forms of narration. There is cinema to discover. Cinema shows us the invisible. It incarnates the past, present and future.",2015,,,Africa,Global South,https://africanartbookfair.com/produit/afrikadaa-8-digital/
AABF,AFRIKADAA 7 – Corps medium,"This issue of Afrikadaa draws from art of many genres to reveal the dynamics of the body and its transformations. For this issue, afrikadaa magazine will transform its space into a medium body.  As is known, in the 21st century the body has been a significant site for exploration in a variety of artistic media. It is the tool of creation par excellence. It is for this reason that we have taken it as an organizing theme and created a space to reflect upon it.  We are concerned with privileging analysis that is not only capable of bringing to light the inscription of the body in artistic media, but also which take into consideration interactions between the body and media. The body is a concrete incarnation as much as an ideology— or, at the very least, an aid to the expression of ideas and theories. Indeed, certain artistic practices apprehend the other as a dematerialized presence. In these particular cases, the incarnation no longer passes through the body.  This disruption brings about a multitude of others. In literature, for example, what might be said about the body that is made as a signifier for a character? What are the stakes for the body in the construction of the individual? In visual arts, these questions might be asked in the same terms. How does art take responsibility for the disappearance of the body? How does it give presence to the body’s absence?  Many contemporary images show us a body that has been reworked, manipulated, objectified. Playing with codes—sex, race, religion, etc.— this art explores questions of identity. How is the physical a part of identity construction? Is there corporeal excess? What are the stakes of a body that has been deconstructed by a work of art? When the body is made of physical material, what might learned with the sense of touch?  Why is the body the vehicle for artistic work? What might we say about the body that is the medium or the screen of the work? What might be said about the body as spectacle?  Taking into account social discourse, the body is also something that receives art.  Let us consider the colonial body of Frantz Fanon. In Fanon, the black man dreams of being white, but what do the colonialized dream about? To be in the place of the colonizer, as Stuart Hall explains at length: the gaze of the colonizer upon the colonized is one of desire and recognition. When we speak of the colonial body, we must, of course, also understand the body of the master, the flesh of the master (as it is understood in Dany Laferrière’s 1997 The Flesh of the Master), which, alone, has existence as its objective. In this way it seeks to decontextualize the colonialized, the desired/desirable victim ad infinitum. The colonizer receives pleasure upon the body of the colonized, and he depends upon the colonized body for power and worth. Therein rests the ambiguity of the dialectic between the colonized and the colonizer. The black body does not exist without the white. Can we even speak of the black-body-object after Le Code Noir of 1685? This mutilated body, cut into pieces as in Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (1925), becomes the body-desire, the site where manifold fantasies are articulated. The resurging body, exploded, overflowing and redefined as the body of the other, an object of desire and pleasure, is manifest in contemporary African art.  In light of this incarnation, we are in perfect resonance with the present.",2014,,,Africa,Global South,https://africanartbookfair.com/produit/afrikadaa-7-digital/
AABF,AFRIKADAA Special Edition – Be/national,"In collaboration with the South-African publication Chimurenga and on the occasion of the France – South Africa Season, Afrikadaa is proud to present a bilingual special edition titled Be National. At the heart of this special edition, you will find our cross-referenced look at the South African art scene, artist interviews, re »ective articles, literature, critiques and a good dose of creation. Be-National is a dialogue between artistic collectives and individuals coming both from Francophone and English-speaking Africa. The content in this issue is a dialogue on form and substance between two Africas, who look at each other but do not always meet. This unique collaboration between two publications with a focus on contemporary arts allowed us to build an unexpected bridge of culture, a common re »ection around the act of artistic creation. BE NATIONAL is a project that was envisioned as a geo-specific narrative, where the reader is invited to discover a rich and diverse, emerging South African arts scene. The editorial team worked in favor of various narratives, with the sharing of knowledge and experiences at the core of everything. Let us guide you through an unexpected journey into this amazing place that is the South-African scene. On December 20th, we introduced our audience with the first act of this collaboration, an editorial act that drew its life from the artistic practices of both publications, a living entity, which we hope, suitably accompanies the Season in its temporality. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to all the authors and artists who contributed to this special issue: Chimurenga, L’Institut Français, Le MAC/VAL, Le 104 for having us in residency, and La Gaîté Lyrique who invited us for the BE NATIONAL live editorial act.",2014,,,Africa,Global South,https://africanartbookfair.com/produit/afrikadaa-be-national/

Aftertomorrow,Random Edition 01,"Random Edition is a publishing project of the Art-Space-Hopping festival of urban artistic practices (ASH for short), launched by the festival team to highlight the artists, processes, and ideas that shape and influence the Moscow art scene alongside galleries and major institutions. We publish works, conduct interviews, and co-publish texts with authors and artists whose work we follow, communicate with, are friends with, or dream of meeting. Through this collaborative project, we aim to support and strengthen connections within the community, create opportunities for professional growth for its participants, and make the art scene less hermetic for a wider audience. We dedicated the first cycle of Random Edition to artists whose practices extend beyond personal artistic expression and professional careers, but also organize and support spaces and environments for other artists. These are the initiators of artist-run spaces: Dishon Yuldash, Anya Tagantseva-Kobzeva, Slava Nesterov, Yan Possadsky, Dima Filippov, and others. RE was conceived and designed at the intersection of several genres: magazine, samizdat/zine, and, simultaneously, archive (for which we thank our designers Misha Filatov and Dmitry Gusev). It was important for us to remain within the visual code recognizable by the community, as if the artists themselves created their own magazine—which, in essence, is close to the truth. Each issue is compiled from two materials: (1) interviews with the featured artists and (2) artwork by a guest author, executed in a printed format—zine, print, image series, etc. Additionally, the issue may include exhibition reviews, curatorial texts on upcoming events, or a calendar of events at independent venues. Thus, Random Edition aims to become an artistic archive/documentation of a cross-section of the independent Russian art scene in 2024-25. The first cycle's edition will be compiled and presented as a catalogue at the final exhibition, along with the original works.

The Angry Bat,Goodbye Meadow,"Goodbye Meadow is a deeply personal journey through memory, loss, and rediscovery. Filippo Zambon returns to Prato, a city he once left behind, to confront its past and his own. Through intimate photographs and poignant text, he navigates the streets of his childhood, the spaces his mother inhabited, and the emotions of a long-awaited homecoming. This photobook is more than a documentary—it is a meditation on grief, identity, and the ties that bind us to place and family. I left Prato nearly 20 years ago without hesitation. Prato—whose name literally translates to meadow—is an industrial town neighboring Florence. For many years, I felt completely disconnected from the city of my youth. A difficult relationship with my mother, along with a lingering sense of unease about the provincial mindset of its inhabitants, kept me away. In 2021, when my mother’s fragile health took a turn for the worse, I was forced to return to Prato to handle practical matters. This period marked the beginning of a profound nostalgia for the place where I grew up. Homesickness set in as my mother’s condition rapidly declined. During this time, I began photographing her, her home, and the city. In early 2022, my mother passed away suddenly. Throughout her hospitalization and in the months following her death, I continued the project, also incorporating written material alongside the photographs. In 2023, I returned to further document the city—this time focusing on elements that could connect our memories to the place. Through this process, I sought to intertwine my life with her experiences, discovering connection and meaning in a city that holds both of our histories.",2025,Filippo Zambon,,Europe,Global North,https://theangrybat.com/product/goodbye-meadow/
The Angry Bat,The Abyss,"The series The Abyss captures more than mere landscapes; it encapsulates a profound narrative of our contemporary era, marked by turmoil, isolation, and introspection. Each image, devoid of color yet rich in contrast, serves as an allegory for the challenges we collectively face – the wars that rattle our sense of security, the pandemic that has reshaped our existence, and the deeply human experiences of longing and love. The series Abyss focuses exclusively on one motif. It is the night motif of a sea pier, which the artist pursued over a longer period of time. The title Abyss indicates the symbolic significance of the series that the photographer himself interprets as a response to current political affairs and a feeling of the spirit of the times we live in. The pier as a temporary and limited space of current residence on which strangers coexist, images of people indicating a point in the distance or bending over the water as if searching for answers in it, images of a secluded pier in total darkness, photographs of lightning and close shots of the sea, all this evokes an allusion to the current images of refugees who are following points in the distance, reaching unknown territories, talking to strangers on that same pier, and staring at the sea on which their survival depends. Only few elements of the narrative are specifically highlighted; each change in the framing, each gesture or attitude of protagonists in this empty space immersed in the darkness resonates more strongly. He thus achieves various effects, ranging from calmness to drama, using minimal variation. Broadly speaking, we can also perceive the Abyss as an illustration of our own existence in all its ranges: finding the right direction, approaching the coast, coexisting with strangers, surviving storms and unpredictable seas, and finally moments of confiding closeness of two lovers with whom the series ends. Hence, with love that gives meaning and (solely) shows a way out of the abyss. ",2024,Matej Sitar,,Europe,Global North,https://theangrybat.com/product/the_abyss/

","A Queer Park is an exploration into what it means to have queer visibility in our city of New Orleans. After years of researching queer monuments and public spaces, I’ve come to an understanding of how queer sites of memory and representation are received by the public in western culture and why or when that reception is met with violence or discord. This exhibition lays out the different projects that have led to this proposed park, my research on queer public monuments and spaces, and what a queer public site in New Orleans could one day look like. Ryan Leitner is a collage artist, with an artistic inquiry towards the visualization of queerness through the body, history, and space.

Anthology Editions,Making A Way: Lesbians Out Front,"JEB (Joan E. Biren) first introduced viewers to her photographs in 1979 when she published Eye to Eye: Portraits of Lesbians, a groundbreaking celebration of women loving women. In the years that followed, JEB collaborated with poets, musicians, filmmakers, elected officials, healthcare providers, factory workers, spiritual leaders, and others who built communities and worked for political change. Her second book Making a Way: Lesbians Out Front, published in 1987, depicts the spirit and energy of this movement in more than a hundred emotionally resonant photographs that take us from passionate activism to thoughtful solitude, while remarks and remembrances from each woman photographed deepen the historic record. This reissue of Making a Way adds insightful new essays by Cheryl Clarke and JD Samson, resulting in an essential document of an era whose impact continues to be felt across our society today. JEB (Joan E. Biren) has been influential by actively challenging the representation of lesbians, the way we understand photographic history, and how we speak about image-making. She has documented LGBTQI+ lives and communities since the 1970s, publishing groundbreaking books and making award-winning films. Her first book, Eye to Eye: Portraits of Lesbians, was reissued to international acclaim in 2021 by Anthology Editions. The Dyke Show, a slide presentation JEB toured with through the 1980s, was recently digitized and is now exhibited in video format around the country.

Ralph worked alongside friends, designers, and models from the storied queer sanctuary to create joyful spectacles and iconic looks in the sun and sands of the Rockaway Peninsula. Now, on September 22, 2024—on the occasion of Ralph's Red Hot at Riis Beach party, the revival of Ralph’s Beach Parties to the People’s Beach, co-organized by Ralph with Gili Rappaport (green flash projects) and Halo Kaya Perez-Gallardo (Lil’ Deb’s Oasis)—Anthology is thrilled to present They Call Me the Mayor at Riis Beach: Ralph’s Beach Parties 1994–2000. Featuring more than 100 photographs alongside reflections by Ralph and his collaborator Gili Rappaport, They Call Me the Mayor at Riis Beach is a celebration of the historic parties as well as a unique document of artistry, inclusivity, and wondrous beachfront fashions on Ralph’s signature glittering mylar runway. Ralph Hopkins (he/him) is a 76-year-old native New Yorker residing in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. Known as the Mayor at Riis Beach, he threw participatory beach parties there in the 1990s involving fashion shows, DJs, and food, and has been a consistent presence at Riis for the past six decades.

Anthology Editions,Other Networks: A Radical Technology Sourcebook,"The internet as we know it is not a foregone conclusion. Indeed, the present corporatized, monolithic, surveilled state of our networked communications is just one possibility out of many, and there is radical promise in uncovering hidden alternatives: from pirate radio to barbed wire telegraph, from synthesizers transmitted over the telephone to encoded messages bounced off the surface of the moon. Other Networks is writer and researcher Lori Emerson’s speculative index of communications networks that existed before or outside of the internet: digital as well as analog, IRL as well as imagined, state-sponsored systems of control as well as homebrew communities in the footnotes of hacker culture. Featuring explanatory descriptions of each network, archival images, and original artwork by Robert Beatty, Other Networks documents historically alternative networks with a particular eye towards their experimental usage by artists and writers. The result is a boldly creative taxonomy of our networked world, a liberatory sourcebook for readers eager to escape the hegemony of technological history, and a lovingly designed guide to the freedoms and communal possibilities that have been lost along the way. Lori Emerson is an Associate Professor in the Media Studies Department, Founding Director of the Media Archaeology Lab, and Director of the Intermedia Art, Writing and Performance Program at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is co-author of The Lab Book: Situated Practices in Media Studies (2022) and author of Reading Writing Interfaces (2014). Her research focuses on uncovering crisis points in past media, points at which there was the possibility—even if never fully realized—for technologies that are definitively other than those we have now. She also deconstructs narratives of how contemporary technologies came to be by looking at artists' and writers’ experiments with network technologies.",2025,Lori Emerson,"40.7128, -74.0060",North America,Global North,https://shop.mexicansummer.com/merch/495898-lori-emerson-other-networks-a-radical-technology-sourcebook
Anthology Editions,Some Collages,"Although Jim Jarmusch is best known for his storied career in independent cinema, over the years he has produced hundreds of pieces of collage art, the majority of which has been rarely seen by the public. Drawing inspiration from the largest medium of cultural documentation—newspapers—Jarmusch delicately crafts each work by layering newsprints on cardstock. Doppelgänger Andy Warhols are posed in a vast tunnel not unlike the depths of the Large Hadron Collider, Patty Hearst’s mugshots drift across Edwardian portraits, and a man’s identity is disguised with a coyote’s head: maybe he was a celebrity, politician, perp, or all three. In Some Collages, these small-scale (notecard-size) pieces not only pay homage to the documentation medium but are a reminder of how even mundane images can be reconfigured into work that is alternatively funny, scary and strange. Jim Jarmusch is a film director, writer, musician, producer, and artist. A prominent figure in independent cinema, his notable films include Stranger than Paradise (1984), Down By Law (1986), Dead Man (1999), Broken Flowers (2005) and Only Lovers Left Alive (2013).

Containing hundreds of selections from 2011 to 2021, during which Kohlmann crafted countless works on paper using sumi-e ink washes and other techniques, Emma Kohlmann: Watercolors is a survey of an artist working intuitively to generate representative possibilities that are playfully otherworldly and resolutely, thrillingly free.

Arsenal Pulp Press,The Antifa Comic Book,"With fascism in our midst, Indigenous artist Gord Hill revises and expands his brilliant graphic history of fascism and anti-fascist movements. When it was first published in 2018, Gord Hill's The Antifa Comic Book was heralded for its searing imagery documenting the history of fascism and anti-fascist movements over the last century. In the years since its publication, the term ""antifa"" has been co-opted by the right to falsely describe far-left political extremism and even terrorism. But the role played by antifa movements in fighting fascism and racism around the world remains as relevant and important as ever. For this expanded edition, Gord Hill adds new material depicting more recent flashpoints of fascist activity, including the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, the murderous spree by Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik, the infamous 2022 Canadian convoy protests, and Islamophobic and anti-migrant sentiment in a growing number of fascist governments in Europe. At the same time, Hill depicts the important work being done by anti-fascist individuals and organizations to combat this worrisome trend, made all the more crucial by Donald Trump's return to the White House. Powerful and inspiring, The Antifa Comic Book is an important reminder of fascism in our midst and what can be done to stop it.",2025,Gord Hill,,North America,Global North,https://arsenalpulp.com/Books/T/The-Antifa-Comic-Book-Revised-and-Expanded

A Multigenerational Family Odyssey
Show Details","Beginning with her mother's stroke in 2014, Teresa Wong takes us on a moving journey through time and place to locate the beginnings of the disconnection she feels from her parents. Through a series of stories - some epic, like her mother and father's daring escapes from communes during China's Cultural Revolution, and some banal, like her quitting Chinese school to watch Saturday morning cartoons - Wong carefully examines the cultural, historical, language, and personality barriers to intimacy in her family, seeking answers to the questions ""Where did I come from?"" and ""Where are we going?"" At the same time, she discovers how storytelling can bridge distances and help make sense of a life. A book for children of immigrants trying to honour their parents' pasts while also making a different kind of future for themselves, All Our Ordinary Stories is poignant in its understated yet nuanced depictions of complicated family dynamics. Wong's memoir is a heartfelt exploration of identity and inheritance, as well as a testament to the transformative power of stories both told and untold.",2025,Teresa Wong,,North America,Global North,https://arsenalpulp.com/Books/A/All-Our-Ordinary-Stories
Arsenal Pulp Press,Tsqelmucwilc: The Kamloops Indian Residential School - Resistance and a Reckoning,"In May 2021, the world was shocked by news of the detection of 215 unmarked graves on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School (KIRS) in British Columbia, Canada. Ground-penetrating radar confirmed the vestiges of children as young as three on this site of the infamous residential school system, which systematically removed children from their families and brought them to the schools. At these Christian-run, government-supported institutions, they were subjected to physical, mental, and sexual abuse while their Indigenous languages and traditions were stifled and denounced. The egregious abuses suffered in residential schools across the continent caused - as the 2021 discoveries confirmed - death for too many and a multigenerational legacy of trauma for those who survived. ""Tsqelmucwilc"" (pronounced cha-CAL-mux-weel) is a Secwepemc phrase loosely translated as ""We return to being human again."" Tsqelmucwilc is the story of those who survived the Kamloops Indian Residential School, based on the 1988 book Resistance and Renewal, a groundbreaking history of the school - and the first book on residential schools ever published in Canada. Tsqelmucwilc includes the original text as well as new material by the original book's author, Celia Haig-Brown; essays by Secwepemc poet and KIRS survivor Garry Gottfriedson and Nuu-chah-nulth elder and residential school survivor Randy Fred; and first-hand reminiscences by other survivors of KIRS, as well as their children, on their experience and the impact of their trauma throughout their lives. Read both within and outside the context of the grim 2021 discoveries, Tsqelmucwilc is a tragic story in the history of Indigenous peoples of the indignities suffered at the hands of their colonizers, but it is equally a remarkable tale of Indigenous survival, resilience, and courage.",2022,"Celia Haig-Brown, Randy Fred, Garry Gottfriedson",,North America,Global North,https://arsenalpulp.com/Books/T/Tsqelmucwilc

Through a mixture of fanciful musing, rigorous inquiry, and unflinching self-reflection, Of Floating Isles reframes the gamer's retreat from others not as social isolation, but as a quest for a different community, one where they feel seen, heard, and understood. This deep-seated longing to belong, Guillermo suggests, forms the imaginative worlds of video games and the floating isles they conjure. By exploring their own lifelong attachment to video games, Guillermo shows how games can spark rage, confusion, and the desire to escape, but these emotions are not necessarily bad - they are the growing pains that many young people must work through. So too can games provide reflective realms to dwell, to imagine, and to build spaces for queer, trans, racialized, and neurodiverse groups. Envisioning games as forms of poetic interaction, Of Floating Isles boldly conveys their truth-telling powers: their ability to offer guidance in times of loss and hardship, and their power to reveal the oppressive mechanisms of our ""real"" world.",2025,Kawika Guillermo,,North America,Global North,https://arsenalpulp.com/Books/O/Of-Floating-Isles
Arsenal Pulp Press,The Future Is Disabled,"In The Future Is Disabled, Leah Laksmi Piepzna-Samarasinha asks some provocative questions: What if, in the near future, the majority of people will be disabled - and what if that's not a bad thing? And what if disability justice and disabled wisdom are crucial to creating a future in which it's possible to survive fascism, climate change, and pandemics and to bring about liberation? Building on the work of their game-changing book Care Work: Dreaming Disability Justice, Piepzna-Samarasinha writes about disability justice at the end of the world, documenting the many ways disabled people kept and are keeping each other - and the rest of the world - alive during Trump, fascism and the COVID-19 pandemic. Other subjects include crip interdependence, care and mutual aid in real life, disabled community building, and disabled art practice as survival and joy. Written over the course of two years of disabled isolation during the pandemic, this is a book of love letters to other disabled QTBIPOC (and those concerned about disability justice, the care crisis, and surviving the apocalypse); honour songs for kin who are gone; recipes for survival; questions and real talk about care, organizing, disabled families, and kin networks and communities; and wild brown disabled femme joy in the face of death. With passion and power, The Future Is Disabled remembers our dead and insists on our future.",2022,Leah Laksmi Piepzna-Samarasinha,,North America,Global North,https://arsenalpulp.com/Books/T/The-Future-Is-Disabled
At Last Books,Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow,"For the first time, Peter Funch’s iconic photographic series Babel Tales and 42nd and Vanderbilt are brought together in a single book. The publication features texts by Professor Mette Sandbye, architect Ane Cortzen, author and art historian William Pym, gallerist Jesper Elg, and the internationally renowned authors Douglas Coupland and Paul Auster. Since the beginning of his career, Peter Funch has impressed audiences with his photographic series, which, rooted in street photography, capture incredible situations and seemingly random encounters between people in urban spaces. With a sharp eye for detail and the decisive moment, Funch creates photographs that appear as spontaneous snapshots but are, in fact, the result of years of meticulous observation and precision. Babel Tales was initiated in 2006 and completed in 2024. The series consists of now-iconic photographs where time and space merge into extraordinary moments. The series 42nd and Vanderbilt, created between 2007 and 2016, presents daily observations of Manhattan’s morning rush hour. From the same street corner, Funch spent years documenting repeated actions and routines, forming a fascinating portrait of human behavior amidst the chaos of city life. Together, the two series constitute a powerful visual exploration of the relationship between the individual and the collective. While Babel Tales portrays collective moments and layered narratives, 42nd and Vanderbilt focuses on individuals and their daily rituals. These series are particularly relevant today as they prompt reflections on the tension between the individual and the collective, between self and society, and on power dynamics and surveillance. Funch’s striking images continue to convey themes of unity and connection, countering the divisive forces of our time. Simultaneously, they probe the ways in which we each feel increasingly watched by unfamiliar eyes. The role of the photographer is not neutral, and these works challenge us: What do Funch’s photographs reveal to us today that we were too distracted to notice before? Bringing these two projects together in a single volume offers a unique opportunity to revisit and reinterpret them. The combination of the series opens up new readings that both reflect and challenge our understanding of the themes they explore, inviting reflection on the world we live in today. The book also includes a chapter featuring archival and process material such as experiments, notes, drawings, and collages—all elements that have been directly worked on by Peter Funch. Together, these pieces form a visual and conceptual timeline documenting the creative process behind Babel Tales and 42nd and Vanderbilt. This collection not only highlights the individual strengths of each series but also underscores their shared ability to delve into complex topics such as surveillance, power structures, and the individual’s role in public spaces. It offers a renewed perspective on everyday life and fosters meaningful conversations about the relationship between the personal and the collective.",2025, Peter Funch,"55.6761, 12.5683",Europe,Global North,https://www.atlastbooks.com/shop/p/pf-tomorrow

Beijing Silvermine,17 18 19,"The series 17 18 19 is drawn from a bag of negative film salvaged from a recycling plant on the outskirts of Beijing in 2010. The bag contained an archive of over 15,000 scratched black and white negatives, shot at one of the city’s detention centers between 1991 and 1993. Pocket knives, screwdrivers, shovels, stolen cash, clothing, jewelry and home electronics are placed before the camera ; the photographs clearly present evidence and mugshots of the accused, but they are entirely cut off from any further information. They have survived only as inverted images, trapped on film. Presented here in their original form as negatives, the camera behaves as an X-ray machine the objects glow in a grey void, creating daunting still lifes of an unexpected kind. Unsettling and beautiful in equal measure, every item these people have left behind, whether a weapon or an object of desire, is preserved like an artifact, a fossil for our examination. The evidence if often displayed alongside a referential three-centimeter ruler where the numbers 17, 18, and 19 appear. Albeit utilitatian in function and form, the negatives, objects of the passage of time, distance us from the unidentified hors-champ events to which they bear witness.

Beijing Silvermine,Great Leaps Forward,"Great Leaps Forward unveils a series of photos drawn from a plastic bag bought in a Beijing flea market in 2016. Sealed tightly with a knot, the bag had settled there unnoticed for many decades. Upon opening the bag, over 300 photos were discovered, taken by an anonymous member of the Xi’an Physical Education University’s department of Photography. All the images, meticulously depicting various athletes in action, often defying gravity, were shot on the same field during a bright day of June 1960. To date, these images are the only photographic record that collector and artist Thomas Sauvin found from the time of The Great Leap Forward (1958-1962). During these years, a chaotic industrialization campaign meant to transform China from an agrarian economy to a new communist regime rooted in industry and large-scale agricultural production led to the deadliest famine of human history. Any photographic documentation from these years remains extremely rare. In this posthumous collaboration with an anonymous photographer, this publication invites us to contemplate a strangely metaphorical aerial ballet on the margins of history.",2019,Thomas Sauvin,,East Asia,Global South,https://www.beijingsilvermine.com/great-leaps-forward

Every day, throughout that tumultuous spring of 2020, Erik and Thomas sent one another idiosyncratic, uncaptioned photographs; catalysing an organic, free-associative exchange of some 120 archival images. Atelier Éditions’ author Kingston Trinder then composed an equally free-associative, altogether-whimsical narrative with which to further entwine the duo’s eclectic photographs. These two archives of vernacular photography, one from the East, the other from the West, achieve a dialogue through the recurrence of photographic practices, aesthetics, and subjects. Talk Soon, a tearaway postcard book, allows readers to endlessly juxtapose the delightful photographs selected by the two quarantined artists.",2021,"Erik Kessels, Thomas Sauvin",,East Asia,Global South,https://www.beijingsilvermine.com/talk-soon
Beijing Silvermine,On this day,"On November 17, 1997, a Chinese woman posed in front of a wallpaper cityscape of the New York skyline featuring the World Trade Center. Later, on August 23, 1998, and February 27, 2000, a scaled-down replica of the Twin Towers appeared behind middle-class Chinese visitors at a popular Beijing theme park filled with copies of world landmarks. Finally, on September 12, 2001, a photograph was taken off a TV screen showing the World Trade Center engulfed in flames. The event that became known as 9/11 was witnessed the following morning in China, and dramatically recasts the previous images, which together allude to some of the mediated ways that Chinese citizens have participated in recent American history. Personal photographs are largely impervious to public events, but their inescapable imprint is visible in retrospect. On This Day is a new sample of Thomas Sauvin’s vast archive, ‘Beijing Silvermine’. That archive is the result of an intervention by the French collector that is now legendary:  anonymous colour negatives were salvage from being melted down for their silver content from a recycling plant on the outskirts of the city. Instead, over many years living in China and now back in Paris, Sauvin bought the dusty negatives by the kilo in old rice bags. Now numbering over 850,000, the negatives span twenty years from 1985 to 2005 – from the time amateur cameras, films and labs became widely available to the Chinese middle class to their disappearance with the rise of digital cameras.  These are not discarded memories, since the ‘original’ prints may still be safely treasured in family albums in Beijing. But Sauvin’s digital scanning of the discarded negatives has yielded an extraordinary alternative life for the images. The twilight of point-and-shoot film photography was also a time of massive transformation in Chinese society, and the archive provides a unique insight into everyday Chinese desires and aspirations. The standard repertoire of snap happy moments – birthdays, weddings, holidays, portraits of wives and girlfriends and cats – is supplemented by an unusually large number of photographs of people posing with new consumer items such as refrigerators and TVs, uniquely Chinese rituals such as brides lighting multiple cigarettes for men at weddings, military costumes, Mao posters and giant pandas. Every image suggests a story. But Sauvin never wanted to be the sole author of the archive, and constantly seeks new perspectives on it in collaboration with others. Swedish artists Klara Källström and Thobias Fäldt are logical collaborators, given their publications have also sought to excavate complex layers of history and explore the gaps between what is visible and knowable. When Sauvin gave them a hard drive with thousands of images to contemplate, they were drawn to the faded orange date-stamps that appear on about a quarter of the prints. For a brief window before the demise of popular film photography – prefiguring the embedded metadata of digital images – point-and-shoot cameras imprinted LCD-style dates onto negatives. Such photographs are literally an index of time itself. Källström and Fäldt turned to the Internet for information about some of the specific dates, which alerted them to the popular history site onthisday.com, with its lists of political and sporting events, celebrity marriages and deaths. The site is probably most visited by people seeking to discover what happened on the day they were born, and offers a relentlessly Euro-American perspective – with scant information about Chinese history. By using the date stamped photographs to drive their investigation, one readymade archive driving the other, they force together two incommensurable sources of incomplete information about the world. Two inadequate descriptive systems, as Martha Rosler might say, the gap between them complicating the self-evidentiary claims of each other, revealing their obvious omissions and biases.  Sauvin’s image archive points to China’s ambivalent relationship to the West. Simulations of the New York skyline, a single bottle of Perrier, a Chinese basketballer posing in front of a poster of US player Michael Jordan, a party of giggling women the day the World Wide Web was born, a Chinese tourist posing in front of the Eiffel Tower, obscured by a finger over the lens. In this context, amateur mistakes and damaged images take on a particular pathos. Temporally and culturally displaced, photographs that once made sense to someone intimate become a puzzle – eccentric, abstract and poetic (someone doing a push-up with a pillow on their back, a woman sitting on a bed with a hand over her face in front of a poster of a nude). We are always on the outside; we know nothing about the scenes beyond their rough location and precise date, charging them with mystery. The scanned images were printed in Paris, their corners rounded, then sent to Sweden to be glued to pages where events from onthisday.com have been hand-typed on a manual typewriter. So-called event of interest, according to the website, are highlighted with an actual highlighter pen. In this way the book simulates a quasi-bureaucratic archive and evokes something like evidence. But the evidence is nonsensical and apparently random. The images are not even organised chronologically. Instead, they are arranged by a number appearing at the bottom right of each page, which represents the order the negatives were first scanned into Sauvin’s archive. The fact that 9/11 is the last image in the book suggests another narrative. The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center marked the symbolic end of the American century. Just as the list of celebrity divorces points to Western decadence, the found photographs hint at the birth of what is now known as the Chinese century. On the day the American poet William Burroughs died, a fluffy white cat stretched upwards on a chair in Beijing.",2021,"Klara Kallstrom, Thobias Faldt, Thomas Sauvin

Beijing Silvermine,Verso,"I like to see the identity photo as a fossil, a sort of human imprint fixed on a layer of paper. Banal, repetitive, monotonous, these ultra-standardised portraits are somewhat the antonym of artistic portraits and yet, beyond their signal functions, a certain charm emerges from these faces forced to neutrality. In this series called VERSO I plunged into my collection gleaned in China over the last fifteen years. The series was born simply. By exposing these photos to a strong light source, we discover the print by transparency while very laconic information, written in a more or less singular calligraphy, appears on the faces. These handwritten notes provide us with allusive information about unknown people who obviously no longer belong to the administration of the living. A name, a place, a date are all that remain of these lives reduced to mere squares of paper, fragile deposits printed on fibres. And yet, can we imagine better traces to evoke their passage? It is as if the fusion of the front and back sides, bringing a face and modest biographical elements into the same plane, opened up a new register, that of a latent encounter between an image and its hidden face.",2022,Thomas Sauvin,,East Asia,Global South,https://www.beijingsilvermine.com/verso
The bildungsLab,Art that cares. Art(pedagogy) as collective care,"In times of global crises and increasing divisions, we are called upon to examine viewing habits and perspectives and, if necessary, to 'unlearn' them. Colonial residues in education, politics, culture and society can also be addressed with a new perspective on the theory, practice and mediation of art. Art makes it possible to enter into authentic communication with one another, to encounter ourselves, to (further) educate ourselves and also to communicate with our environment. Aesthetic educational processes hold the potential to pause, to set rigid positions in motion, to open up new spaces for thought and to allow new things to grow. Building on this understanding of art and art education, the sixth volume in the resistance & desire series examines aesthetic approaches in the educational context, which the authors see as a network of care for oneself and for others.",2024,,"52.5200, 13.4050",Europe,Global North,https://www.bildungslab.net/en/buchreihe/

Whether in the oppressive episodes of the private sphere or in the dark times of the political: pain and affects such as fear and disturbance are, not without reason, the source and inspiration for numerous forms of artistic expression. It is an attempt to give voice to the dismay and suffering, to capture the horror. However, rarely is horror addressed in its unvarnished form and its political dimension. In Beyond Horror – Horror, Resistance, and Visions, we turn our focus and examine the transformative power of horror as a creative means of resistance in a world shaped by power structures and inequality. We view the horror film as an artifact that raises deeper societal and political questions. The volume brings together two essays, a screenplay, and explores the topic from theoretical, discursive, aesthetic, and practical perspectives. In the hope of finding a resistant approach to horror that does not turn a blind eye, but instead confronts it.",2025,,"52.5200, 13.4050",Europe,Global North,https://www.bildungslab.net/en/buchreihe/

Ongoing economic crises as well as macho and infrastructural violence against feminized BPoC bodies drive the diasporic movements and knowledge productions present in this anthology. Based on reflections by Latin American and Caribbean authors on cultural and artistic approaches, the contributions demonstrate the transversality of feminist practices in a wide variety of ways.

Looking at the topic of food from a critical and diasporic perspective makes questions of belonging, discrimination, and identity close and tangible, which are otherwise usually negotiated on a more intellectual level. For example, what desires and wishes do we express through what we (don't) eat? What (anti-)colonial traces can be traced in different drinks, dishes, foods, in eating and drinking habits? How are class and food related to each other? Can food, can cooking be resistant or political? Poems, short prose, essays, autobiographical reflections, scientific analyses, scenic texts - as diverse as the questions are the approaches the authors* choose to question supposed unambiguities, to renegotiate national and cultural attributions, to draw connections between the (post)colonial past and the present, between the personal and the political.

Reflective, (self)critical, unruly, ironic, indignant, their texts want to reveal the violence of knowledge (epistemic violence) and western-eurocentric representational power to a certain extent and thus deconstruct it.

Blow Up Press,Homesick New York,"Michael Ackerman’s Homesick New York is a deeply personal meditation on memory, belonging, and the enduring pull of his home town. Returning to New York City after a long absence, the artist sets out on quiet wanderings through the streets, parks, and subways of a city both familiar and transformed. What emerges is a body of work shaped by intuition and empathy — a series of intimate encounters with strangers with whom Ackerman shares a mysterious emotional connection. Each portrait is the result of silent recognition, shared presence, and mutual vulnerability. Rather than documenting the city itself, Homesick New York turns toward an inner map of longing. The artist gravitates to individuals and spaces that carry the aura of dislocation, fragility, and quiet strength. Shot on analogue film using a variety of formats and processes, the photographs are imbued with a tactile richness and temporal softness that evoke fleeting memories — as though we are catching glimpses of something beloved that is already fading away. Diptychs, triptychs, and subtle sequences add rhythm to the narrative, revealing layers of meaning and emotion that unfold slowly, like a dream half remembered. A distinct element of the book lies in its use of test strips — photographic leftovers from the printing process, left soaking for weeks in chemical solutions. Once dried, they bear marks of decay and transformation, ghostly echoes of the original image. In the book, reproductions of these spectral fragments are woven like relics of a memory in flux — imperfect, beautiful, and haunting — and each is carefully torn and glued in by hand after the printing process. In one of the collector’s editions, an original, signed strip is also included as an additional piece. This book is not a document of New York, but a love letter to the people who shape it — and to the fleeting, unrepeatable intimacies that emerge when we open ourselves to strangers. It is an embrace of human mystery, of imperfection, and of beauty that resists explanation. It is a reflection on loss and rediscovery, guided by a simple, urgent desire: to connect, to care, to see — and to be seen.",2025,Michael Ackerman,,Europe,Global North,https://blowuppress.eu/collections/bup-publications/products/homesick-new-york
Blow Up Press,Encyclopaedia,"Jungftak, (n.) a Persian bird, the male of which had only one wing, on the right side, and the female only one wing, on the left side; the male had a hook of bone, and the female an eyelet of bone, and it was by uniting hook and eye that they were able to fly. Whatever encyclopaedia we reach for, we are used to treating it as a source of knowledge about the world, people and phenomena. A source about which we have no doubt that the information it contains is verified and true. But what would happen if it were otherwise? The Baldock Beer Disaster, occurred on March 14, 1904, when an unstable storage room floor collapsed at the Simpson Brewery, in what is now Simpsons Drive, in the North Hertfordshire town of Baldock in England. Around 300 barrels and crates of beer fell three floors through the brewery. Some surrounding streets were temporarily hit by a wave of beer, which reportedly destroyed three houses and killed a dog. Weronika Gęsicka undertook the heroic project of searching old encyclopaedias for entries that had been created in order to prove plagiarism in the form of illegal reprinting of their content. She illustrated each of the headwords she found in her own way: by modifying stock photos and creating new images using artificial intelligence. In this way, a unique Encyclopædia of fake events, animals, characters and objects was created. Mountweazel, Lillian Virginia, 1942-1973, American photographer. She was awarded government grants to make a series of photo-essays of unusual subject matter, including New York City buses, the cemeteries of Paris and rural American mailboxes. But behind this seemingly amusing collection lies a very important question: how can we function in an age of information manipulation and fake news, when even encyclopaedias cannot be trusted? What sources can we rely on to ensure that they do not provide fabricated data? How can we distinguish between fake news and reliable information?

Blow Up Press,Hotel of Eternal Light,"We associate light with hope, redemption and salvation. For us, light is an announcement of something new and good. But what if it had a completely opposite meaning? If it were to be used to deprive us of any hope, would it serve to subordinate one person to another, to take over one’s thoughts, to permanent surveillance? Hotel of Eternal Light is a visual investigation of dictatorships and totalitarian systems in the recent history of Europe. Using an example of the abuse of power by the Stasi, the secret political police of the former communist German Democratic Republic, the book focuses on the use of light as a form of control, torture and communication code. Photos for the book were taken in the former secret Stasi prison in Berlin-Hohenschönhausen. Not knowing where they were being held, its former prisoners described it as the Hotel of Eternal Light, where constant artificial lighting was a tool to suspend time and annihilate their inner selves. To break the psyche of prisoners, various methods of white torture and light were used, from X-rays, through light corridors, flashing lights, blinding, to black isolation. As Hannah Arendt describes in The Origins of Totalitarianism, such a radical experience in isolation and loneliness leaves us unable to experience the world, unable to make sense of reality, unable to trust our own sense of the self. In addition to documentary photos taken in the prison and its hospital, the book also uses other media, such as scans of traces, photographs of items belonging to prisoners, portraits of prisoners, experimental X-ray scans, archival photos and fragments of conversations with former prisoners conducted over the last few years. In the light of the currently growing popularity of totalitarian doctrines, Hotel of Eternal Light is also an attempt to address, what our freedom actually consists of in severe times of loneliness and how much potential the inner urge for it reveals in the face of an imposed ideology.  ",2024,Karolina Spolniewski,,Europe,Global North,https://blowuppress.eu/collections/bup-publications/products/hotel-of-eternal-light
Blow Up Press,Dame Gulizar and other Love Stories,"Once upon a time, in distant Constantinople, there lived Hadji Garabet Kevork Topakian, a well-known and respected producer of basturma, considered by many to be the best in the city. Garabet led a lonely life until one day he fell deeply in love with the beautiful and young Gulizar, who - to his joy - reciprocated his feeling. They were an adorable couple. Unfortunately, their love was opposed by Gulizar's parents, for whom Garabet was too boorish. Unable to come to terms with the loss of his beloved, one frosty night he snuck on horseback to her bedroom window. Without hesitating for long, Gulizar threw herself into her lover's arms and together they left for Constantinople to get married and live happily ever after. Distant Ararat, illuminated by moonlight, was the only witness to this kidnapping… For Dame Gulizar and Other Love Stories, Rebecca Topakian’s starting point is the unique story of her Armenian family, who lived in Turkey before her grandfather emigrated to France. This story is the love of her great-grandparents - Garabed and Gulizar. Topakian explored this part of her identity by choosing fiction and mythology. Bearing the love story of her ancestors in mind while she traveled and lived in Armenia, desire became the thread of this project: it is a desire for earth, ground, identity, but also for the other’s body acting almost as a mirror. The book includes her own pictures mixed with her family archives, establishing a link between past and present. And the photographs printed on transparent paper symbolically put her great-grandparents back to the land they belong to, offering an intimate and impressionistic portrait of Armenia.",2024,Rebecca Topakian,,Europe,Global North,https://blowuppress.eu/collections/bup-publications/products/dame-gulizar-and-other-love-stories
Blow Up Press,Eternal U,"Imagine that after death you will become a tree, part of the forest, unlimited and free energy. A lively monument will grow on you. Eternal U is a story about the so-called good death and eternity. Through photographs of forests being natural cemeteries where the dead are buried in biodegradable urns or coffins, marked only with a previously selected tree, Humka shows a certain way of thinking about us as a code, an immortal chain of some larger universe. During life, we all draw from it, to later give it a part of ourselves:  In each of these places, the forest itself, giving eternal rest to the people buried there, was the most important element for me, - says Hubert Humka. - There I photographed the soil in which they rested and the bark of the trees they became. I like to think that the roots of these trees, drawing from the people buried under them, include them in their existence, that nothing ends, that it is only our human self that changes. We become a tree, a forest, part of something bigger that reaches beyond us. We connect with the universe, we become infinite.   Eternal U is the second, after Death Landscapes (2018), joint publishing project of Hubert Humka and BLOW UP PRESS. The book was created in the spirit of sustainable development, respect for the world and the surrounding nature, on ecological recycled papers. Its main axis are photographs of the forest (life), accompanied by negatives (death) and embossed text about leaving (traces we leave behind).   With this book I close my own trilogy of death, - says the artist. - In Evil Man I portrayed victims of homicide and suicide. In Death Landscapes I talked about landscapes tainted by trauma and death. In turn, Eternal U, in my opinion, brings peace, tames death, shows its completely different face.",2023,Hubert Humka,,Europe,Global North,https://blowuppress.eu/collections/bup-publications/products/eternal-u
Blow Up Press,The Need to Know,"Michael Honegger’s father was a spy during the Cold War. Bilingual in German and English, he worked for the U.S. Air Force and sent agents into East Germany and elsewhere behind the Iron Curtain. The Honeggers lived in West Germany between 1959 and 1963 during the height of the Cold War. None of the family members had any idea about the father’s work life and all questions about it were answered with the same, predictable response, Do you have the need to know?, followed by a smile and silence. It was not until long after he retired that he finally shared a few details of his career as a counterintelligence special agent. This project is an exploration of the meagre details that emerged from those brief conversations and Michael’s curiosity about Cold War espionage and its impact upon his family at the time. His father led two lives that rarely intersected. His family members were often the unwitting participants in indecipherable events that left them with many more questions than answers. Mysterious strangers would show up at their apartment late at night only to depart before dawn without saying a word to anyone other than his father. Peculiar encounters, curious radio transmissions, and unexplained coincidences became the norms of his childhood. I now have the need to know more about the secret world my father inhabited and the lives of others with whom he interacted. This project is a photographic re-creation of the intersections and divergences of his secret life and the traditional paternal role he played. Ironically, several the archival photos in the project were actually shot by me and my father on separate trips to West Berlin in the winter of 1961 but were only re-discovered recently. So, it becomes an interesting intersection of the factual and fictional based upon historical research, family archives, my memories, and my imagination. The project is particularly timely as the issues of the Cold War have evolved and continue to play out on the international stage. The current war in Ukraine is just one example of the evolution of the conflict. The espionage tools of the 1960's look primitive to a degree but they, too, have changed to conform to the current applications and tools used for cyber-warfare and propaganda purposes. The cycle of history continues to unwind in an ever-repetitive pattern.",2023,Michael Honegge,,Europe,Global North,https://blowuppress.eu/collections/bup-publications/products/the-need-to-know
Blow Up Press,Object Amnesic: A Compost Manifesto,"Henrik Strömberg (artist) and Jens Soneryd (writer) started their joint project The Compost in 2016. For them, the compost is a point of departure to explore alternative ways of being in the world, alternative practices of doing, thinking, sensing, seeing, and understanding. With alternative ways of being in the world they refer to perspectives that challenge the instrumental and reductionist ones that are predominant today, which provide a technocratic attitude towards the world, its objects, structures and societal institutions, but also toward its humans and other living beings, its nature, language and art. According to the technocratic attitude, art works are means for communicating simple messages or for performing certain functions, and they are valued according to their potential of doing so - the aim of the work of art is to deliver certain measurable results that are decided in advance. Thus, contemporary art is part of the creative economy, it is attuned to the logic of advertising, design, and tech companies. Within this view, lives are translated into projects, human beings are translated into brands that compete on various markets such as the labour market, the education market, the love market and so on, while nature appears first and foremost as something to be predicted, controlled and dominated, translated into a function as convenient resource. Thus, forests are transformed into either agricultural land or tree plantations, rivers into hydro-plants, mountains into mineral reserves or ski-resorts. Failures, eccentricities and deficits are hidden in the pursuit for simplicity, success, and perfection. Human-as-brands lead active, social and eventful lives, not primarily for the joy of learning, experiencing, meeting people, and so on. Verbs like living, experiencing, encountering, loving, desiring have no intrinsic but only functional values. The actions they signify aim only to stage an eventful and prosperous life on social media; living as branding, that is. Is it possible to love a forest that has become a tree-plantation? A river that has become a hydro-plant? A human being that has become a brand? A work of art that can be translated into a simple message without anything being lost in translation? A nature whose meaningfulness has been replaced with functionality? Probably not. Therefore, object amnesic: a compost manifesto aims to contribute to the re-enchantment of the world, by translating back functions into meanings, tree-plantations into forests, answers into questions, and first and foremost by turning our attention to the processes rather than to the intended results. The book deals with topics such as growth and decay, memory and forgetting, permanence and change, the desiring gaze and the detached gaze. It also reflects on technologies for understanding, such as writing and photography. These are powerful technologies developed as aides for making visible, mapping, fixing, organising and governing. In short, they are powerful tools for keeping, controlling and preserving. object amnesic: a compost manifesto explores if and how these technologies also can be applied in opposition to their intended usages, if they can also be deployed to un-learn what we have learned from them. It questions the predominant technocratic Cartesian view on nature as something to be measured, predicted and controlled. It challenges the very notion that control is a desirable achievement. Instead of trying to control and to govern artistic or natural processes, the book encourages us to join these very processes, to become part of them, or simply to acknowledge that we already are part of them despite that we most often pretend not to be. And just like any compost, the book is an assemblage of things in various stages of completeness as the objects in the compost are not registered, and no actions are undertaken to save them from oblivion or decay - forgetting is just as important as remembering, ambivalence and doubt are just as important as knowledge and certainty. To reach without being able to reach is just as important as grasping. The aim of a compost is not to reach answers, explanations, or conclusions, but to produce fertile soil. So is the aim of this book.",2021,"Henrik Strömberg, Jens Soneryd",,Europe,Global North,https://blowuppress.eu/collections/bup-publications/products/object-amnesic-a-compost-manifesto
Blow Up Press,Land,"Land is a story about the place and people belonging to it. A personal reflection on the place where the traditions of different cultures mix with one another, the place that witnessed to events that erupted with the World War II, the place which industrial prosperity is already over, where the past gives way to the present. For the first time, Lorenzo Castore came to Gliwice in the late 1990s, looking for a new way to express his emotions. Enchanted by the people he met on his way, he returned to this side in nearly 20 years. The book is a summary of his wanderings, it is a photographic diary of travel that exceeds the frame of time. In his story, Lorenzo focuses on people. Although they remain unnamed for us, we feel special sympathy for them, this kind of closeness that is possible only when it is honest. And this is exactly what Castore's photography is like: balanced, focused, respectful and open to other people.

Blow Up Press,Death Landscapes,"We often admire the beauty of surrounding landscape. We admire its landform, plants, we contemplate HERE and NOW. But if and how often we think about what actually happened in this place in the PAST? To a large extent it depends on our knowledge of the particular place’s history. But what if we don’t know anything about it?  DEATH LANDSCAPES is the second book by Hubert Humka. This time, Humka focuses on the landscapes. They are contaminated landscapes, marked by their history: on the one hand, they are idyllic, but on the other – they contain the stigma of the events that they silently witnessed. In the seemingly immovable landscape one can find cracks, splits, even physical scars. The traumatic events that left them were of different nature: from collective (battle field or terrorist attack) to tragedies affecting a single man (suicide or victim of a murder). Is the ‘Love Path’ on the small Norwegian island of Utøya still as it was before the blood of the assassin’s victims soaked in? How does the idyllic charm of the place break down in the context of trauma, leaving a stripped landscape? But most of all, DEATH LANDSCAPES is a story about man. It is an attempt to answer the question: Is a conducive intersection of time and space revealing the dark side of his/our nature? Is it possible to approach the dark truth about a man/us through landscapes? Hubert Humka’s book contains a number of inserts that give it additional meaning. There is a report on the death penalty execution or a never published before diary of a serial killer, among others.",2018,Hubert Humka,,Europe,Global North,https://blowuppress.eu/collections/bup-publications/products/death-landscapes
Blow Up Press,Erna Helena Ania: The Artist's Cut,"The true story of a mother's love for her daughter, inscribed in the history of the end of the World War II and its aftermath, told by a grandson, in whose life its elements sound echo like. The end of the WWII. Polish-German borderland. A young German woman falls in love with a Polish guy. Back then, this kind of relationship between enemies was prohibited: both of them could be killed, if that would be discovered. Moreover, she gets pregnant and is hiding her pregnancy. After the war, she is imprisoned in the camp for Germans. She gives birth to the author’s mum but, because of her poor conditions, is not able to raise her and has to give her away.  The European borders were changed after the WWII by the decision of a few key political figures and almost all Germans were expelled (the largest forced migration in history). The woman, hoping to be reunited with her daughter, decided to stay but had to gain Polish nationality. For her, as ex-German, life in Poland was extremely difficult. She lived in the shadow of guilt and memories of what had happened in Poland during the WWII. All her family had been expelled. And it took many years for her to be with her daughter together again. Tomasz Laczny: The story of my grandmother is a story about losing identity, family, and country in the face of traumatic historic events. It represents the situation of many people and nations finding themselves struggling with finding their own identity after the war in the shadow of Nazism. Ironically, the story of my grandmother unfolds some similarities with my own. Living abroad for many years I experienced disconnection and isolation and struggled with finding my new identity.

Bored Wolves,Cartoon Graveyard,"Joey Perr’s comic book Cartoon Graveyard is composed of vignette-like scenes chronicling Joey’s relationship with his late father, the artist Herb Perr, during the final years of his life—a period shaped by the onset of a neurological condition.

Joey drew the original Cartoon Graveyard page, in a navy blue somewhere between tender affection and tender bruising, a year after his father’s passing, the morning after the two bumped into each other in a dream. This would be the first of a sequence of oneiric encounters, during which Herb doles out advice from the peanut gallery in the sky; is reincarnated (turns out he was okay); and, despite his son’s best efforts, comes apart at the seams.

Bored Wolves,Bodywork,"In Bodywork, the writer, visual artist, and psychotherapist Eva Tuschman Leonard situates herself, through word and image, in two states of being two decades apart: as a physically expressive and active body in its twenties; and as one later subjected to the debilitations of autoimmune disease, requiring the daily labor—the titular Bodywork—of pain management. And yet a linear timeline cat’s-cradles itself when Eva rediscovers a cache of works on paper, the majority self-portraits, in a forgotten personal archive. Of the period of their creation, she recollects: Flashback to my late teens and twenties when the life force pulsing through me was constantly searching for meaning. My inner landscape overflowed with dreams, longing, and a hunger to find my place in the world. Art-making became a dialogue, a dynamic conversation between interiority and exteriority. Regarding the drawings from the latter-day vantage of mornings woken to feeling as if I had been steamrolled, my limbs filled with lead, the nerves on the left side of my brain and body radiating pain, the artist is unexpectedly struck by the uncanny prescience of these portraits from the past, with their suggestion of contorted corporeality: Bodies stripped of their contours, bodies unraveling, bodies dismembered, obscured, and partially erased. When I rediscovered these works on paper, created decades earlier, in their abandoned archive, I was astonished by how they made visible the invisible experience of illness in the body. They struck me as eerily prophetic, the mark-making articulating the disorientation of my malfunctioning body as if foreseeing it, anticipating the affliction to come. Then, once more, the narratives of decades initially defined by lack of, or subjection to, pain, helix: At the same time, a passion permeates the drawings, a life force that I can still remember on a visceral level coursing through the young woman who created them. In this way, Bodywork is not just about illness—it is also about ecstasy.

Cisternas’ one-page comics, around which this collection was edited, are poetic puddles, distillations of great lakes as concise as they are expansive. Whether sedentary or ambulatory, these autobiographical scenes are paced to a roaming equal parts restless and romantic. Even when he’s hunched over a page at home, Cisternas is somewhere else: a hillside, a forest, on the shores of a small pond chock-full of Bashō’s frogs; on the shores of a potentially bottomless puddle; on the inverted three-quarter shores of a coastal cloudscape with its pearly capes and coves. The ambulatory comics often begin in the Chilean capital, where Cisternas lives with his family, before drifting across the wildland-urban interface the artist benevolently trespasses on his way to the billboard-less balm of the countryside, with its amphibious encounters, sensory portals to formative childhood memories, and, within the context of a skinny country, enough night sky to make eye contact with the cosmos.",2024,Tomás Cisternas,"50.0647, 19.9450",Europe,Global North,https://www.boredwolves.com/product/puddles

Only the dry fountains are left… Things making appearances in Keramidas’ sempiternal scenography might initially strike one as memorably motionless. And yet blossoms on rocks are touched; a marble staircase shifts; an archaic flag flaps; polka dots crash. And herbs cause quite a stir. Throughout, there is an element of idiomatic tag, with a thought traced back and forth through a warren of Greek, Italian, French, and English (Alex’s fourth language) as the poet navigates her tongues and selves in an attempt to turn lingual knots into lanyards. There is, too, sage and rosemary on the nearby hill / (noisy, noisy herbs). The zine’s cover art is by Rowena Hughes. Potentially sentient undulant elasticity.

Ranging from the terrain of Southern California to sojourns and seasons amidst vibrant Arizona desert and the thick forests of central Maine, the poet shapes a collection meeting the question: How does one live well and with purpose while also navigating the daily reality of depression? These poems describe experiences when even proximity to the people and places usually capable of providing solace fails to alleviate the dead weight of despondency. What happens then, when one is unmoored by the flow of a depressive interiority into a frangible external environment? Rigby’s poems expand the possibilities for what it means to remain tethered to a planet on which life may tenaciously teem even in the absence of rain. Throughout, she seeks to regain the purpose from a time / when women fed birds / fed all the birds.

Bored Wolves,Kitchen,"In Zürich there is a calm kitchen, in which all food containers are stripped of their labels, and in the kitchen there is a table with two wooden chairs. At one of these chairs sits artist Ingo Giezendanner (pen-and-ink name GRRRR) with his treasure tin of colored pencils within reach—every tip sharp. Natural light slants over his shoulder onto the table’s checkerboard pattern, which could be described as blue-and-white, although the blue shifts over the course of a day from cobalt to Prussian to cyan and turquoise and back again and the white has creamed over time. At this table, throughout the boxed-in years of 2020 and 2021, Ingo established a ritual of drawing the objects in front of him at a given moment. The result is Kitchen, a pocket-sized (9×13.2 cm) compendium of 49 colored-pencil drawings.

Bored Wolves,Cracked Shells,"24-page zine by Swiss-Greek artist Dimitra Charamandas which, through prose poetry fragments and ink drawings, tells of a day spent probing a Greek shoreline’s little inlets, i.e. a collection of potential openings; a small crack, an injury; the result of discharging energy, the rupture of a previously protective shell. Cracked Shells establishes the presence of Dimitra sketchbooking on the threshold of sea-slapped slabbed Grecian ground seared and buckling while she meditates on punctured chelonian carapaces, humanity as emigrant panspermia cast across the cosmos, and the slackening blue hour when even that which is carved in stone ungrips its unambiguity.",2023,Dimitra Charamandas,"50.0647, 19.9450",Europe,Global North,https://www.boredwolves.com/product/cracked-shells
Bored Wolves,Combustion Suite,"After I perform a dance, I write a poem. This is my most truthful account of that experience, begins dance artist and poet Duhita Cori Kresge. However, she caveats, Dance time has its own elusive logic. It seems that when I dance I am not me. I am emptied. I become an observer, a satellite, an animal, an oracle, a current, a lens. I can only try to tell you what happened. In Combustion Suite, Kresge plumbs a series of metamorphic performances, shedding her body’s word-skin as she reveals the proscenium’s feral fringes in cycles of shapeshifting, lancing, blazing, keening, and surfacing. Combustion Suite doubles as rekindled refraction of Combustion, a piece by choreographer Wendy Osserman—Kresge’s dance-mother and kindred collaborator of decades—limited to a single performance due to the pandemic. The premature halt compelled Kresge, one of its dancers, to summon these poems from the experiential ash in which they held their breath.",2023,"Duhita Cori Kresge, Sanya Kantarovsky","50.0647, 19.9450",Europe,Global North,https://www.boredwolves.com/product/combustion-suite
Bored Wolves,Notes from a Polish Allotment,"Crossing the allotment patio to wash my brushes at the outdoor sink one morning, I saw to the southeast a plane descending towards Warsaw’s Chopin airport, and remembered how I’d originally made my own way, via tarmac and boulevard, to the neighborhood where we were to live. Surrounded as I was by the enormous idea of Poland, and the slabbed expanses of its capital, I found myself unpacking a need for gardens. Which Alex Rossiter, in Notes from a Polish Allotment, proceeds to do across a haibun weave of prose, haiku, and pencil drawings divided between the book’s two parts: the first covering the transplanted artist’s arrival in Warsaw, the second, his discovery of the allotment gardens, a quirky Arcadian wedge of greenery in the heart of the city’s Mokotów district. Attuned to the moods of mud, lancing of light, and shivers of vine across the seasons, and with a healthy interest in the idiosyncrasies of his fellow allotmenteers, Rossiter adopts a typological approach softened by empathic curiosity. Throughout, he seeks to locate himself while reflecting on what it means to be a foreigner sinking hands into local soil.",2023,Alex Rossiter,"50.0647, 19.9450",Europe,Global North,https://www.boredwolves.com/product/notes-from-a-polish-allotment

We’ll be donating all sales from this book to Voices of Children, a Ukraine-based aid organization that provides psychological support to children who have witnessed war. It uses art therapy and storytelling to support children’s well-being, and provides financial support to families who have suffered as a result of war. Voices of Children has been active in Ukraine’s east since 2014, when Ukraine was first invaded, and has since expanded its endeavors to the entire country. The Stoneware Jug is a collection of poem-comics by Stefan Lorenzutti (words) and John Porcellino (pictures), in which American comix legend Porcellino (King-Cat, Thoreau at Walden) pours the adapted poems into his pen-and-ink panels, as if into a handmade vessel. Each one-page comic is a seasonal diorama of sorts, preserving a moment in time unfolding in the interstices of time: between the chinks of a log cabin in the Polish Highlands, fissures in late-spring ice, and the gap between coziness and creeping concern on a brutally cold winter’s night.

Sixty minutes into planetary lockdown, as gas clouds flare diabolically across the horizon, a burst pipe floods Selcan Peksan’s Istanbul apartment. Encircled by notebooks and companioned by her beloved German shepherd, the poet seeks to transcend claustrophobia and eco-anxiety by envisioning a future unpeopled planet supporting novel mutations of non-human life. Come Lockdown Year Five, the subterranean rumbles of resurgent nature coalesce into a riotous carpet of overgrowth subsuming virtually all signs of human civilization.

Bored Wolves,The Endless Loop in My Mind,"I begin walking up the spiraling stone steps, one by one. The deep crack that splits the fifth step in half winks at me. This time, I am careful not to trip on it, and continue on…In her artist’s book The Endless Loop in My Mind, NYC-based Turkish artist Seçil Koman uses prose and paintings to channel the remembered palette and contours of her grandmother’s apartment in Izmir during childhood summer holidays: Heart Apartments, Unit Four. I take another step. Right in front of me is the brown apartment door with its burgundy doorknob. No. 4. From the sound of her orthopedic house slippers, I can tell my grandmother is walking toward the door. With a little thrill, I ring the bell. Its jingle intermingles with the chirping of the birds in the center of my chest. The door opens in time to the twittering of the birds. As she describes her grandmother’s apartment—with its grape-flavored balcony, ballad-playing radio, and cocooned wardrobe—Koman’s prose (translated, from the Turkish, by Anna Wood) combines the tingling expectancy of E. Nesbit and Perecquian attention to detail to probe formative childhood memories of spaces once synonymous with security. In a single motion, I am hugging my grandmother. My eyes are shut tight, and I inhale the scent of her floral shirt. I am welcome.",2022,Seçil Koman,"50.0647, 19.9450",Europe,Global North,https://www.boredwolves.com/product/the-endless-loop
Bored Wolves,This Party of the Soft Things,"Once upon a time, Nhatt Nichols, a poet and graphic journalist working out of a hut on the Olympic Peninsula, followed forest paths in search of the sea and something resembling clarity, even as she faced up to the ambiguities of being fully alive during an age of malaise, collapse, and extinction. Returning to her writing and drawing hut, Nhatt set to work on This Party of the Soft Things, a book-length poem written and illustrated over the course of a year. This Party of the Soft Things can be described as a highly re-readable picture book for adults, with its fifty graphite drawings plotting and expanding upon Nhatt’s poem and the trek underpinning it. The poem pivots between ruminative present-day interludes and accelerations into a distant future in which humans lose their claim to proper nouns (texas is just that and no more) as armies of potato bugs, air forces of mosquitos, and navies of sharks ascend. In the meantime, planetary implications are localized by a backroad and a mailbox, a mug and a bottle of rye. And in lieu of a shiny grail at quest’s end, Nhatt embraces the radical solace of a future humans won’t be around to endanger.",2021,Nhatt Nichols,"50.0647, 19.9450",Europe,Global North,https://www.boredwolves.com/product/this-party-of-the-soft-things

That Alina was two at the time, and Anita her mother, is relevant. Equally relevant is the plane of parity on which their everyday companionship unfolds. She Threw the Rope & Pulled the Lake is what happens when an adult listens to a child closely and takes her musings, observations, and inquiries seriously. The book begins along the angle of Alina’s vision, in relation to a home’s windowsills and the stacked streetscapes of Istanbul. Anita’s line, in the spirit of Franciszka Themerson and Harold and the Purple Crayon, then carries us across the page and over the arch of a day, encompassing moments of inspiration and parental energy dips, playground excursions, the quivering autonomy of bedtime, and the bond established through breastfeeding.",2021,Alina Asan & Anita Sezgener,"50.0647, 19.9450",Europe,Global North,https://www.boredwolves.com/product/she-threw-the-rope
Bored Wolves,The Pleasures of Empty Lots,"I left Istanbul after graduating from high school, in 2006. It was only in July 2015, less than a year after Erdoğan assumed the presidency, that I found myself living in the city again full-time, to conduct manuscript research and improve my Classical Arabic reading skills. My parents’ railroad apartment was a location where I lacked the liberty to edit my poems in peace and to cultivate the sense of ‘poetic bewilderment’ so beneficial to my practice. I therefore had to put on my shoes and abandon it. And with that, poet Efe Murad sets off into the streets of his native Istanbul, wandering in search of empty benches, weedy lots, and myrrh-scented subterranean shrines—gaps in the claustrophobic concrete, beyond the reach of the regime and the police, where a young poet with his pockets full of inky drafts is free to sip a can of beer and puff like a magic dragon. Finally, at the end of a dead-end overlooking the sea, Efe finds a spot where he can edit his visceral verse in something like peace as the sun sets, a coup brews, and jellyfish accumulate off the coast of Kadıköy.",2021,Efe Murad,"50.0647, 19.9450",Europe,Global North,https://www.boredwolves.com/product/the-pleasures-of-empty-lots
Bored Wolves,A Promenade at Home,"Here, each memory is like a child in need of protection. I myself am like an institution. Where could I go with all my institutionalism? Even if I leave, my habit will remain. I cannot break the habit of my habituation. I cannot break the habit of this habitation. Equal parts lyric and performative, A Promenade at Home is a meticulous cataloging of possession in all its forms. Revisiting her childhood home in Istanbul in spirit, poet Sevinç Çalhanoğlu overhears a conversation between her mother and the sentient house, their dialogue a cantillated litany of decorations past and present. Meanwhile, her mother bustles about with broom and bleach, seeking to disrupt the settling of dust and malefic hexes in rooms that arrange themselves into a theatrical set. As Sevinç proceeds to piece together painful memories of coming of age in this middle-class, Muslim household, she reckons with an interior’s ability to occupy its occupants—specifically her mother and, through osmosis and inheritance, the poet-daughter—and explores how a home touched by grief can become a haunted space. With cathartic intent, Sevinç excavates the microhistorical, retrieving memories long muffled by carpet in an effort to assuage the white noise of trauma. I must learn to live with this noise. This noise, is here, to keep me, alive. A Promenade at Home is comprised of two self-contained poetic works, each illustrated by Sevinç with its own set of art: the titular A Promenade at Home, a weave of poems, fragments, and performative dialogue, arranged together with abstract monochromatic watercolors; and the previously unpublished Melancholia: An Inventory, a prose-poetry hybrid of domestic diary and institutional guided tour, illustrated with drawings of household artifacts.",2021,Sevinç Çalhanoğlu,"50.0647, 19.9450",Europe,Global North,https://www.boredwolves.com/product/a-promenade-at-home

Keys in the sun, keys in the shade, this is the book of poems he made. In Sweaty Leaves, Petter Dahlström Persson’s poems alternate between mellow in-between moments with mint-colored eggs in your palm and the guttural viciousness of gulls. Meanwhile, a high-speed Intercity Express train foreshortens between dormant interwar dairy factories. The futuristic train tries to be fast, but Petter has a way of decelerating the present until it reverses into the past, or at least into a snack break. The poems are accompanied by odd and oddly logical ink drawings of the collection’s motifs: water drops dripping into rippling puddles, a perspiring igloo, Shade itself slipping and sliding, and the friendliest of keyholes.

Guided by a ruler and drawing with black marker, she charts her day-to-day existence along diaristic axes, from runic spikes of Mood and Productivity to soaring Time Spent in Kitchen and steadily increasing Awareness. The majority of the zine’s graphs focus on the period from late March to late May, when New Yorkers were under stay-at-home orders with the city’s boroughs in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic. The final graphs transition to two overlapping phases in late May to early June: On a personal level, Sevinç leaving her apartment with greater frequency, generating kinetic volition via bicycle. And then joining New York’s mass street protests in response to the May 25 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers. After months of enclosed distress, a communal, open-air outpouring of grief and fury, with righteous chants quietening only for candlelight vigils.",2020,Sevinç Çalhanoğlu,"50.0647, 19.9450",Europe,Global North,https://www.boredwolves.com/product/my-life-in-curves-recently

Bucle Editorial,We Captives,"The first lockdown imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need to establish meeting points, to share, and to create. Thus, the possibility arose of creating a virtual artistic exchange between Buenos Aires and Paris. The works in Nosotras Cautivas are constructed using the exquisite corpse technique, created by the Surrealists in 1925. It is a sequential composition, in which each participant draws on a sheet of paper and then folds the contents, leaving only a portion of the drawing visible. In this way, each artist intervenes in the collective work, following only the clue received, without seeing the content of the previous creation. The collection is composed of several triptychs, in which three artists have been invited to intervene in one of the three sections A, B, and C of the work. The identities of the participants have been kept secret, and the final results of the finished works are revealed in this publication. The project grew and was built with participants from Argentina and France, establishing links between young and established artists, known and unknown, local and distant, forging connections between people and their works. For more than two years, Nosotras Cautivas (Nosers, Captives) worked to invite, collect, organize, and successively forward the leads to the artists who contributed to the works.

Born from our subconscious, our life experiences, altered states, personal perceptions and emotions, these visions and creatures – often closer to monsters and animals – populate our personal and bizarre inner universe, an abstract and tangible mental space, with which we are usually confronted. Robi Alfano and Jorge Pomar connect with this mental space, sketching this sum of personal perceptions and outlooks through a spontaneous, direct, essential and raw form. Title: that’s the last thing I would decide is the result of the intersection between the respective minds of the two artists. Robi Alfano and Jorge Pomar create a varied and personal fauna of fantastic animals, working in solitude, separated by more than ten thousand kilometers.

","Using a large 8x10 camera, Yoshimi Ikemoto has captured a now lost world in photographs: the old owner-led shops in Japan’s San’in region, Ikemoto’s home. In glorious detail, Ikemoto’s photographs have soaked up and preserved the unique flair, atmosphere and individuality of each store and workshop. Due to their owners spending almost every waking hour of their lives in these spaces, they have become like an extension of their personalities, with every tool, every item, every scratch in the floor or furniture revealing another little story. With its large size and many fold-outs, On Display turns Yoshimi Ikemoto’s series of disappearing stores into an engaging experience. The book also includes an afterword by the artist as well as essays by photographer Iseo Nose and curator Azumi Akai about the context and cultural importance of Ikemoto’s photographs (all texts included in Japanese and English). In general, the larger the medium that records a photograph, the larger the sense of a spatial dimension that unfolds within the image. The large-format camera offered Ikemoto the exquisite ability to record all the minute details of a space. As a result, this photobook represents an unparalleled journey into the worlds of vanished shops. Ikemoto’s images captured not only shopkeepers of various trades but also the details of their workplaces, the tools they used and even the atmosphere of their everyday lives. They reveal entire worlds... Looking at these images means confronting the past as it was experienced by Ikemoto, but it is within this bygone past – or rather, because this past no longer exists – that his photographs acquire reality and actuality.

Chimurenga,"Chimurenga Chronic: Brandfort, Liberation Capital [1977-86]","A special edition of Chimurenga Chronic, exploring the intellectual, social and political work of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela during the period of her banishment in Brandfort from 1977-86. Banished to Brandfort in 1977, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela noted that this act, carried out by the apartheid authorities, was intended to bury me forever. However, it was her presence that ultimately repositioned the small rural town in the Free State as a centre for black radicalism. Before Mama Winnie was removed from Soweto, along with her daughters Zenani and Zindziswa, and dumped outside of 802 Mothupi Street, Brandfort, the town was infamous as the location of British concentration camps, during the Second Anglo-Boer war, and the once home to Hendrik Verwoerd, a man synonymous with apartheid.

Tanks, armoured vehicles and military personnel are seen patrolling the capital, Harare. The images send shock waves through social media, traditional broadcast news networks and diplomatic channels. After nearly four decades at the helm, President Robert Gabriel Mugabe, Commander-in-Chief, is set to be deposed by his own army, the Zimbabwean Defence Force.

Chimurenga,Chimurenga Chronic: Who Killed Kabila II,"Who killed Kabila? This issue of the Chronic presents this query as the starting point for an in-depth investigation into power, territory and the creative imagination by writers from the Congo and other countries involved in the conflict. 8 years after the assassination of Laurent-Désiré Kabila, rumours still proliferate. But who killed Kabila is no mystery. It is not A or B or C. But rather A and B and C. All options are both true and necessary – it’s the coming together of all these individuals, groups and circumstances, on one day, within the proliferating course of the history, that does it. We’ve heard plenty about the danger of the single story – in this issue of Chronic, we explore its power. We take inspiration from the Congolese musical imagination, its capacity for innovation and its potential to allow us to think with the bodily senses, to write with the musicality of one’s own flesh. However, this editorial project doesn’t merely put music in context, it proposes music as the context, the paradigm for the writing. The single story we write borrows from the sebene – the upbeat, mostly instrumental part of Congolese rumba famously established by Franco (Luambo Makiadi), which consists in the lead guitarist playing short looping phrases with variations so slight only trained hips can pick up. Similarly, to follow Ousmane Sembene’s late-style of multi-location and polyphony as decolonial narrative tools, we invited writers from the countries directly involved and implicated in the events surrounding Kabila’s death (DR Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola, and a de-territorialised entity called AFDL) to write, all, the same story. Working fluidly between fact and fiction, and featuring multiple forms of writing, the contributors – Yvonne Owuor, Antoine Vumilia Muhindo, Parselelo Kantai, Jihan El-Tahri, Daniel K. Kalinaki, Kivu Ruhorahoza, Percy Zvomuya and Sinzo Aanza – use the event-scene of the shooting is their starting point to collectively tell the single story with its multiplication of plots and subplots that challenge history as a linear march, and tell not the sum but the derangement of its parts.

Chimurenga,Chimurenga Chronic: On Circulations and the African Imagination of a Borderless World,"What is the African imagination of a borderless world? What are our ideas on territoriality, borders and movement? How to move beyond so-called progressive discourse on freedom of movement and no borders against the backdrop of deeply Western individualist thinking, something that ultimately keeps up and even reinforces the neoliberal market logic and the nation state (that, as we know, is more and more becoming the security service of a market place, than provider of any social securities of their populations). Much of this discourse is in the pursuit of individual freedoms – broadly framed as human rights. This issue of the Chronic highlights ideas of circulation that include the notion of justice and collective freedoms. Conceptions of community that do not enforce transparency but rather make room for what Glissant called opacity. The African world has produced plenty of these, from non-universal universalisms, relational ontologies, refusing that which has been refused to you, and keeping it moving.",2018,,"-33.9221, 18.4231",Africa,Global South,https://chimurengachronic.co.za/stores/Chimurenga-Chronic-On-Circulations-and-the-African-Imagination-of-a-Borderless-World-October-2018-p124558836

The aim, of course, is not to dismiss the questions raised by food insecurity, but rather to complicate them, to cook and serve them differently. Necessarily, it must be done with close attention to the mouth – to the feelings of words and sounds on the tongue, and to the fingers, too.

Nevertheless, villages are desolated as soon as the mines depleted, lining up strings of ghost towns on the U.S soil.

dmp editions,WATERFALL#7 ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLIDTUDE,"For the 7th issue, the original idea came from the novel One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez. In this novel, the story of six generations of Buendía Family, he'd drawn a picture of common people and their daily life out of an exotic village named Macondo, yet perceived by the readers as a surreal and magical tale with different living conditions and background. However, it’s still the reality people face in their real life, as artist Yunyu Ayo Shih was once told by a Colombian friend: .....every family can tell you outrageous stories and they would all be true. There is nothing magical about it, don’t call it magical, it would be an insult. If you love us, remember that. The novel becomes a mirror, it reflects the figure of Macondo inside Taiwan with those ridiculous yet familiar craziness in our everyday life. The same place where we born and live now - all those rituals, tales, family histories and the way human beings act - narratives and fictions are hardly be separated. At one point, history and real life would tangle with stories and fantasies, when we look at it in other angles or how we interpret it alternatively, we've forged a new-born story/history. In the issue of ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE, a new novel was built. It’s about the borders, the bloodline, the reality, the FAMILY, and the solitude. How to tell the past is true or not. How things could turn into new figures by being retold or going through a new process by the artists, Between one chapter to another, we’re leaving the space for the readers to enter.",2017,,"25.0330, 121.5654",East Asia,Global North,https://dmp-editions.com/WATERFALL-7-ANOTHER-ONE-HUNDRED-YEARS-OF-SOLIDTUDE
dmp editions,Letter·Callus·Post-war,"This project starts with several journeys between Taiwan and the Indonesian archipelago. There is a lasting connection between these two countries in regard to their histories and current social situations. The colonies had been governed by different colonial regimes. Their native languages were eliminated. And the identity and feelings for the motherland were purposefully diluted. Moreover, whenever the governing body changes, the understanding of history and geography of a nation would be replaced by a new set of knowledge. In the post-war era, many cultural groups and individuals who are put at a disadvantage due to lack of discursive or militant power seem invisible. Yet their voices and memories might still be there despite that they choose to forget. In this exhibition, artists collect fragments of the past, research carefully on traces left in nature, cultural practice and personal micro-histories, and further dig out more means to articulate a discourse beyond the existing definition of politics and geography. What’s absurd and intriguing at the same time is that the residues of the past which could not be properly documented in written history have actually been passed on from generation to generation. They travel in the shadowed rifts, mutating and transforming into similar yet different manifestations in varied regions to be shared and divided.",2020,,"25.0330, 121.5654",East Asia,Global North,https://dmp-editions.com/Letter-Callus-Post-war
dmp editions,A Firetime Story,"The art project, The Hidden South, is an experiment that has Taitung’s indigenous townships in the South-link region as a starting point and brings contemporary art into an unknown realm to facilitate exchange with and learning from the local culture. The south in this context does not refers to the geographical south. Instead, it beckons a deeper spiritual world that emerges from our connection with nature when we are given an opportunity to leave existing knowledge and logic behind to perceive the world rather with bodily senses and memory. In the village, we often make a fire. Upon seeing the fire, it feels like that we are finally home. The power of fire not only kindles the life of civilizations, but also manifests two completely different states; it is an imagery of interweaving virtuality and reality as well as a medium that connects heaven and earth. Most of the stories and ideas in The Hidden South were born around the fire; and this is the origin of the book title, a firetime story. My experience of the hidden south has been a certain diverse and heterogenous oscillating process between past and present, tradition and innovation as well as myths and histories. Through The Hidden South, it is hoped that people could regain the ability to connect with nature, dreams and reality, preserving the fleeting inspiration within a rational mind.",2021,,"25.0330, 121.5654",East Asia,Global North,https://dmp-editions.com/a-firetime-story
dmp editions,Between Screenings,"Between Screenings includes video works created by Taiwanese artist Yi-chi Lin between 2009 and 2020. We can see that Lin’s artistic practice centers around several subject matters, ranging from the marginalized realm of military dependents' villages in relation to the historical contexts to the migration experience in terms of diasporas in East Asia. The artist excavates her own life events and documentation of her family’s history for further investigation, and then deconstructs and transforms memories, dreams, and oral legends into narrative texts. Through Lin’s mastery of delicately bringing moving images and installation together, the style of her image-based creation shows an enchanting charm. It aims to explore Lin’s art universe in depth by dissecting the thinking behind each inspiring moment and by presenting a detailed analysis of her works. Critical writings on observations of her artistic trajectory by scholars are collected, as well as interviews between Lin and other professionals—both researchers and creative practitioners—in fields such as cinema, theatre, literature, and art history. Conceptually inspired by a visual experiment, this book attempts to fashion time-based video works onto the two-dimensional pages of a printed publication. It can be seen as durational contents being played or screened as readers flip through the pages, which, in a sense, allows video works to wander off and exist outside the screen. Between Screenings, then, is no longer a term confined in a place for screenings to happen. It is further a type of practice as a medium for expanded cinema.",2021,Lin Yi-Chi,"25.0330, 121.5654",East Asia,Global North,https://dmp-editions.com/Between-Screenings-Lin-Yi-Chi
dmp editions,No No No No Good Club,"If one says living is a disaster, all we can do is barely make it through one day after another.

No No No No Good Club collects those crumbs seem delightful or unpleasant, they’re photographs of malls, strangers, wedding banquets, walking dogs in parks, party held spontaneously by the shore, abandoned houses, relatives and friends, gigs at the livehouse and so on, scenes that are not only Chen Etang’s inspiration but also his daily routine. Among this collection, moments that were assembled and seized by the artist, most of them were just another exhausting day of our lives, plain and miscellaneous. But under the artist’s eyes, these bits and pieces were glowing through cracks while depicting the outline of the lives of the times, in a passive positive way. Through the works of Chen Etang, No No No No Good Club has showcased a world with fleeting tension on surfaces of things where you could still find a satisfying spot for your own, a world we’re living in at this very moment. Etang Chen, born 1983, based in Taipei, Taiwan. In late 20s, he has become a self-taught photographer leaving his position as a vet.

dmp editions,In Tropical,"Military dependents’ village is a unique cultural landscape and a product of structural historical factors in Taiwan. After the Kuomintang (KMT) party retreated to Taiwan in 1949, housing for soldiers and their dependents were built hastily in enclosed areas. These provisional communities ended up becoming permanent settlements due to political and historical circumstances. Since the passage of the Act for Rebuilding Old Quarters for Military Dependents in 1996, however, many of them faced being relocated or torn down. These immigrant communities slowly turned into marginalized urban heterotopias, eventually becoming fragmented wastelands. The book In Tropical, documents artists Lu Yi-Lun and Lin Yi-Chi’s Zuoying Project, a long-term project running from 2011 to 2016 in which a migration narrative about life in a military dependents’ village in tropical Zuoying is presented. During these five years, artists witness the rise and fall of many villages —from populated communities to ghost towns as people move away; from ghost towns to desolate historical sites after teardowns. Their creative trajectories and fieldwork in heterotopic wastelands are reflected in their journaling and a large amount of visual documentation. Moreover, the idea, tropical, highlights the range of two climates in Taiwan. Tropical and subtropical climates shape different ways of life in the South and the North. When someone travels into the tropical area, not only their geographical location changes but also their bodily senses adapt, which results in an indescribable intimate resonance between artists and Zuoying.",2019,"Lin Yi-Chi, Lu Yi-Lun","25.0330, 121.5654",East Asia,Global North,https://dmp-editions.com/In-Tropical-Lin-Yi-Chi-Lu-Yi-Lun

Editions JOJO,How To Climb A Tree,"Aparna's deeply lyrical photobook is a personal, intuitive image series that episodically documents a timespan when her 10-year-old son was living in a boarding school in Madanapalle, India.  What emerges is a collaborative project between mother and son drawn over five years of communication, wherein the images become meditative, introspective traces of places and moments that felt like home for both of them. Through the visual explorations, the artist takes liberties to re-enact and find alternative imaginings to moments that could not be documented. Interspersed with handwritten letters and illustrations, the book examines how a physical absence or distance can be expressively redrafted through emotional awareness. In this photobook, Aparna creates a safe space - one in which she allows her own vulnerability of the experience of motherhood to slip through while also trying to root her son, giving him a way to return to this time and space again and again. In the letter to his future self, she writes, This book, I hope, will always remind you to seek your favourite tree, find the best branch to sit on, share it with people you love, and find your place in the world.",2024,Aparna Nori,"18.9582, 72.8321",South Asia,Global South,https://www.editionsjojo.com/product-page/how-to-climb-a-tree-by-aparna-nori

Editions JOJO,Cake Cutting,"Cake cutting is a global phenomenon synonymous with celebration, particularly birthdays and anniversaries. With roots dating back to classical Roman culture, the practice was later popularised by German bakeries as a Kinderfest tradition. In our present time however, the act of cake cutting can be viewed as a metaphor for imperial policies and communal conflict, for example violent divisions of land or more symbolic forms of division along socio-economic lines. By examining this practice that is still popular in postcolonial India, the book attempts to expose the inherent hypocrisy behind nationalist narratives that call for authenticity of identity, often placed in opposition to the adoption of Western culture. The ephemeral archive of the internet, at once a vehicle for misinformation as well as a tool for vigilance and veracity forms the vocabulary of this book, exposing the inconsistencies in the dominant narrative by looking at instances of cake cutting as an unwitting player in political posturing and rumour mongering.",2022,Kaamna Patel ,"18.9582, 72.8321",South Asia,Global South,https://www.editionsjojo.com/product-page/cake-cutting-by-kaamna-patel

ESPAC,And if the House Was the Institution,"ESPAC, its collection and lines of work, are the starting point for revisiting notions of the feminine and the domestic through a collaborative dialogue with individuals involved in academia, curatorship, cultural management, and artistic production. With And if the House Was the Institution , and if the Institution Was the House , we seek to problematize these categories, associated with women's work, to consider them not as themes per se, but as policies present in the relationships, productions, work methodologies, and structures within an institution, be it a museum, a school, a family, or any other established form of organization. The term domestic, which refers to the home—and therefore to the intimate and the least visible—also indicates the act of domesticating: teaching how to coexist, to obey orders. In this sense, the feminine, as the energy that reproduces and preserves life, has been constantly forced to become domesticated. However, in a connecting sense, the domestic enables the construction of networks of affection, care, and shelter, as well as spaces for conspiring. In And if the House Was the Institution, and if the Institution Was the House, we do not conceive of the domestic as restricted to the home and the feminine as associated only with women, but rather as powers activated by and within people, initiatives, and ways of creating that confront practices of contempt and invisibility. The materials resulting from the collaborations are a collective exercise in the construction of an archive, both of the project and of the institution itself. The intimacy, conservation, and protection present in the notion of archive resonate with the categories of the domestic and the feminine. This archive will be displayed as a publication and later as an exhibition; both articulate pieces from the ESPAC Collection, new commissions, and existing pieces.",2024,"Laura Orozco, Pamela Desjardins","19.4326, -99.1332",Latin America,Global South,https://espac.org.mx/y-si-la-casa-era

To my surprise, many people made their own versions and shared them online. I thought they were very precious, so I compiled these images into a book, and packaged it in a box along with the physical fabric as a gift.  Because this project started as a tutorial, I wanted to keep the DIY aspects of it, so I also imagined it as a toolkit, with the tools (crochet hook and yarn) and pattern chart illustrated on the box...

","Sun Breaker explores the tropical, modernist architecture native to Miami. Sun Breaker refers to brise soleil, a common architectural element in the tropics that reduces heat gain in buildings by deflecting sunlight. These sun-shading structures take the form of perforated surfaces that are both decorative and utilitarian, allowing for the free flow of light and air through a building’s façade. In Sun Breaker, Stiler also creates a permeable structure for the viewer to look both at and through. This 13-sided, free-form, accordion artist’s book pairs imagery of Miami’s iconic brise soleil architecture alongside perforated arrangements of cut paper shapes on a flat scanner bed. Stiler connects the light of the scanner and the punctuated sunlight streaming through patterned walls to illuminate a loose narrative that incorporates the female figure, an ongoing theme in the artist’s practice.",2014,Ruby Sky Stiler,,North America,Global North,https://exileprojects.com/Sun-Breaker

Fellman’s photographs attempt to decipher the resulting metal maze of interlocking iron sheets, consequently uncovering new designs imposed by nature in Andrew’s forceful wake. Handbound in an embossed metallic cover punctured with actual bolts and rivets, this artist’s book is evocative of an airplane wing twisted into a mass of metal, encouraging the viewer to physically engage with its content.

Fraglich Publishing,"TWANA’s BOX – The Photographic life of Twana Abdullah, Kurdistan Region of Iraq 1974-1992","Twana’s Box can be described in many ways: a journey through a photographer’s rare archive, documenting the Kurdistan region of Iraq from 1974-1992; a son’s quest to find his lost father, who was murdered by a military regime; a young man’s way to piece together the fragments of a scattered family in a scattered culture; the becoming of a photographer who, through the stories of others, starts to understand his own identity in times of war. Twana’s Box is not only the photo book that holds a selection of Twana Abdullah’s archive; it is a unique insight into a time and place in a region that has since completely transformed. Rawsht has spent years piecing together his father’s negatives and stories. His archival work inspired him to become a photographer himself, working for Metrography—the first independent Iraqi photo agency—before immigrating to Europe. This archive opens a door for us through which we can enter the unknown minimal history that historians seldom write about. A photograph is always an invitation for us to think of the moments that played out in front of the camera, and after it was captured, it helps us to see things which we cannot see with our bare eyes. In the case of this photographer, what is made visible is human endeavour… Baktyar Ali",2024,Rawsht Twana,,Southeast Asia,Global South,https://www.fraglich.com/product/twanas-box/

Fraglich Publishing,ICONS OF COURAGE  the last Kayin men with traditional leg tattoos,"Tattooing is deeply rooted in the cultural traditions of Myanmar. Prior to British colonisation, it was common for men of the Bama, Shan, or Kayin to adorn their skin from the waist to below the knees with mythical or animal figures. A completed tattoo on both legs served as a visual expression of manhood and courage. Moreover, the tattoos showed their devotion to Buddhism and served as protection against evil forces. Men of all classes, from laymen to aristocrats, adopted the practice of leg tattooing. Suppressed by the colonial administration, the custom eventually ceased to exist by the mid-20th century. This book is a tribute to the last old men still bearing these traditional marks.",2025,Jens Uwe Parkitny,,Southeast Asia,Global South,https://www.fraglich.com/product/icons-of-courage/
Fraglich Publishing,Indian Minute Camera Photographers,"explores the life-journeys of four photographers in New Delhi, Jaipur and Pushkar. Minute cameras were once widely used in all corners of India providing on-the-spot black and white images for identity cards or souvenir photography in parks, holy sites, tourist spots, and a plethora of street-side pitches. In general, the story of the minute camera photographer has largely been forgotten in the history books as their work primarily catered to a cliental that could not afford the more prestigious and well documented studio photographs. Their cameras, built by carpenters and repaired ad-hoc, also do not fit in our world of manufacturing and classification, one reason, no doubt for the lack of attention it received from museums and collectors. Nevertheless, they documented the aspirations of millions of Indians for decades and reveal a wealth of personal stories from across the social spectrum. The minute camera photographers in this book, Bharat Bhushan Mahajan, Teekam Chand Pahari, Surendar Kumar Pahari, and Kinshan Chand Hemlani are amongst the last practitioners on the sub-continent whose records immerse us in the long-standing practice of minute camera photography in India as a personal and lived art.",2021,"Sean Foley, Lukas Birk",,Southeast Asia,Global South,https://www.fraglich.com/product/indian-minute-camera-photographers-paperback/

Orphans, wounded fighters, civilians. For three years he photographed 10.000 casualties of the conflict with a wooden box camera for the administration of the foundation. When the Taliban took over most of Afghanistan, he was determent to continue working as photographer and took a job for the oppressive rulers; Taking pictures of infrastructure and other Taliban projects. But after a few years he could not bare it any longer and fled to the USA where by chance he encountered the renown photographer Edward Grazda. This was in 2001, just before 9/11. Khalid presented Edward with a photograph of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar, which he took 8 years prior at the foundation. Mullah Omar’s eye was wounded while fighting as a Mujahedin. At this time Mullah Omar, although a most wanted figure, was a mystery and no known photograph of him was available. With the help of Edward the image was made public via Magnum. Disasters of War, edited by Edward Grazda, illustrates a fraction of Khalid’s photographs in his years as box camera photographer. The silent beauty of the weathered images hold a shocking violence of an outrageous occupation with hundreds of thousands victims.

This book offers a unique insight into the photographs that brought a spark of free expression to the fashionable youth of Yangon in the late 1970s. Photo studios around Yangon University and downtown attracted an enormous number of young clients posing in stylish outfits, some of which were even custom-tailored for the occasion. The resulting images are something like an old-school Facebook – an exchange of physical imagery, as the photos were usually shared with friends. The images in the book show that fashion always comes through, no matter the barriers. And no matter what conditions people live in, they want to look beautiful and present themselves as such.

Fraglich Publishing,A tiny visual history of the moustache,"Join us on a visual journey through time and facial hair. The moustache, a symbol of strength, style, and sex appeal. The moustache, a facial hair feature that has adorned the faces of men (and some women) throughout history, is more than just a style choice. For men, it is a symbol of masculinity, cultural identity, and even social movements. From ancient civilizations to modern times, the moustache has experienced an evolution, weaving through patterns of the world’s cultural, fashion, and societal trends. I certainly want to add here at the beginning of this text that many women have natural facial hair, and it is part of our patriarchal dominance that keeps surpressing free facial hair growth or even style for women. There are very few examples in documented history of female moustaches. I added a photo of the painter Frida Kahlo and the princess of Qajar in this book, both incredible women whose moustache was indeed part of their activism. On page 24 and 136 are example of women with nicely groomed facial hair. The images in this book certainly don’t include all moustache styles in every country or geographic territory; it merely provides a small visual voyage of the male moustache.",2024,Lukas Birk,,Southeast Asia,Global South,https://www.fraglich.com/product/a-tiny-visual-history-of-the-moustache/
Fraglich Publishing,Visual History Afghanistan 1980–2004,"Visual History Afghanistan 1980–2004 is a diary-collage by American photographer Edward Grazda, who worked for extensive periods of time in and around Afghanistan over the last four decades. Edward’s fascination for visual identity represented through imagery led him to collect a large array of posters, stamps, newspapers, maps, and other printed materials produced by various Mujahideen and freedom fighter groups in Afghanistan and Peshawar, Pakistan, in the 1980s and 90s. This is a rare record of how these local groups made use of media and promotion with their own voice and creativity. Edward has merged his collection with images and anecdotes from the same period. The book is guided by a visual voice that tells of the deep and long-lasting encounters Edward had in Afghanistan, yet also speaks of the larger struggle of people wanting to form a new environment for themselves. Page by page, we are thrown into a mix of journalistic reportage and personal reflection that is anchored in the people with whom Edward spent time. The 1980s and 90s were two very complex decades in Afghan history. The many groups, political parties and players and their intentions have never been fully recorded and digested. Afghanistan’s history is largely a matter of interpretation, and as these words are written, history takes another step into a very unknown direction. The Taliban have once again taken control over the country and its desperate people.",2021,Edward Grazda,,Southeast Asia,Global South,https://www.fraglich.com/product/visual-history-afghanistan/

Fraglich Publishing,"CHONGQING SOUVENIR – a little tale of Revolution 1967-1968
","The book presents a record of unseen images from shaming ceremonies held during the Cultural Revolution in Chongqing, China. The prosecuted people depicted in the book were dissidents, intellectuals and opponents of the Communist Party who were publicly punished during the violent period of the late 1960s. Records like these are very rare and have not yet found their way into public discussions in China or internationally. As only official photographers were allowed to document these prosecutions, it is almost impossible to find such images in private albums. This led to the idea to collage the images with Chinese photo albums that were produced in the same period and were widely used by members of the public to keep their memories alive. These kind of albums are often beautifully illustrated with ideas of prosperity and the development of society. The images were given to me by an anonymous person in Chongqing, in 2015. We decided to publish the book with a very basic introduction to the time period in English and Chinese, hoping to provide space for interpreting the images further. Clearly, the Cultural Revolution is not the only violent period that is not found in private photo albums or is still actively suppressed from public discussions by governing powers. Post-World War I & II colonial atrocities, for example, are still hardly to be found in Western history books and very rarely talked about in public. This book is not about facts but rather offers an idea on how to bring impersonal images of violence into a personal space of discussion",2021,Lukas Birk,,Southeast Asia,Global South,https://www.fraglich.com/product/chongqing-souvenir/

Though these initiatives are not limited to design as the sole discipline, they are crucial in informing design practice in general. These initiatives are often catalysed by communities outside of the design world, such as artists, writers, researchers, academia, and others. From these convergences and intersectionalities, we observed how those initiatives gave way to the emergence of communities, discourses, artworks, objects, or even strategies.",2025,"Januar Rianto, Almer Mikhail, Shaquille Noorman","-6.1944, 106.8229",Southeast Asia,Global South,https://www.instagram.com/p/DMEseOIyVbs/?img_index=1
Further Reading,"Further Reading Print No.3: Down South, Outgazing Our Views","In our third print issue, we intend to explore the subject of graphic design, the heart of our practice. Up until now, graphic design is still very much perceived as a ‘Western-centric’ discipline, with methods of work and perspectives that are directly derived largely from the West. This situation presents us with an imperativeness to seek more into the practice of graphic design outside of the current canon, specifically in the southern parts of Asia and its neighbouring countries, where we situate our practice. This includes its unique challenges to the region, the approaches that come from its advancement, the values that its practitioners hold on to, and the condition surrounding its cultural landscape. Further Reading Print No.3 begins with a visual abstraction on the juxtaposition of internal and external environments which constitutes a unique way of seeing. In the following pages, history, heritage, and national identities are presented through a multitude of perspectives, each from different nations and cultural backgrounds—from Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, to Indonesia. On a more personal note, the issue also features explorations on one’s sexual identity through graphic design and accounts of living in vastly different countries in the form of a weather report. Diasporic experiences are examined through a selection of books, which is then continued by an analysis of the immigrant experience in cinema studies. In its first instalment, As Viewed By looks into graphic design as a discipline through various professional perspectives, highlighting its intersections and essence as a practice. Through this diverse form of observations, we aim to shed more light on the matters pertaining to how our practices and identities intersect and interact with each other.",2021,"Januar Riantom, Almer Mikhail","-6.1944, 106.8229",Southeast Asia,Global South,http://further-reading.club/index.php/programmes/print-no3/

At the time when openness and disruption have been presented more often than not around many practices and efforts; we see it is just the right time to take a look at the merging and emerging lines that circle around the matters that are surrounding us. Through ‘Boundaries’, we are keen to discuss the subjects of borderlines between areas or fields; points of contact where disciplines integrate with each other and/or expand over one another; measurements that are used to determine and/or evaluate values and practice; along with the influences that are impacting our everyday lives.",2020,"Januar Riantom, Almer Mikhail","-6.1944, 106.8229",Southeast Asia,Global South,http://further-reading.club/index.php/programmes/print-no2/

It encapsulates our behaviour, language, and knowledge as we are shifting from being within small groups into one global community. However, increased connectivity does not equate better connection between individuals, and perhaps counteractively creates a sense of detachment. In the first issue of Further Reading print, we look inwards to respond to the challenges and demands that we are facing as both designer and non-designer; examine our values within sociocultural, political, economic and ecological contexts; and address or respond using our knowledge, skills and resources. In this issue, we delve into the theme of ‘Identity’ and see how the single subject could give rise to different interpretations.",2019,"Januar Rianto, IJ Palar, Putty Dewikarin","-6.1944, 106.8229",Southeast Asia,Global South,

Further Reading,Serving Suggestion No.1,"To consume is perhaps as fundamental an act as it can be. Following crying, it is the first thing we do after birth. Eating and drinking are something we do everyday—sometimes mindfully, other times absent-mindedly—yet the ways in which the act enriches our lives go far beyond mere nourishment. Serving Suggestion’s first issue begins with food as a medium of expression. In the last decades, we’ve seen how food becomes both more complex and nuanced, personal and social, a political subject and an everyday affair, embedded into memories both happy and sad, a representation of ideas from the past and ideas that are yet to come. In the following pages, we are excited to present pieces that explore food in different contexts. Aftertaste highlights our personal connection with food through memories, told in six stories from contributors across the globe. Sharing Table translates tabletop conversations over dinner into a written form. In this issue, we are joined by Arin Sunaryo who shared about his deep appreciation of food, the connection between food and his art, and his favourite places to eat—as we have dinner in one of them. Elsewhere, ‘Fungal Encounters’ takes us foraging for mushrooms through urban areas and beyond. The significance of food throughout different stages of life is explored in reference to Shakespeare’s As You Like It in ‘Rasa Fantasi (‘Don’t Cry Rice’) - Food, Performance, and the Future’, where each stage is related to different works of art. From Berlin, sōydivision penned a write-up on their artistic collaboration with Pei-Ying Lin, which incorporates viruses in culinary experiences. ‘What Shapes a Food Culture? A Case Study of Sundanese Cuisine’ delves into the changes of its titular food culture. In ‘It’s Not Rice But Better’, the subject of food sustainability is explored through alternatives to our staple food. Corners of the nation’s capital are visited through a list of things to taste, smell, and hear in Directory. On the subject of drinks, ‘Drink It While It’s Hot’ examines the changing flavours of various coffees as their temperature drops. In Recipe, we present a comforting cocktail recipe you can make at home. The dynamics of food is something that has always been of interest to us—it’s exciting, all-encompassing, and impactful.

Pompeii today is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that receives over two million visitors per year to view its archeological excavation. Russell puts the mass voyeurism, sensation, extraction, and loss of Pompeii—a devastating moment frozen in time—to work.

GenderFail,Application As Artwork: GenderFail’s Working Class Guide to Making a Living Off Self Publishing,"Application as artwork is the first in a series of works exploring the creative potential and horrible realities of the application process. The publication is centered on the core question: Dear Artist, How much time did you spend last year on applications? I hope it was as much as you spent on your own artwork. From the opening essay: The application circuit in the art world feels like playing the lottery. Within my practice, I have all but given up on applications. It doesn’t sit well with me spending hours upon hours in the off off off chance of getting funding when thousands of other people are doing the same thing. Instead, I focus on using whatever resources I have to make and publish my work. Spending time creating new work to sell instead of wasting time on applications is always a safer bet. I find applications a racket that would ruin my ability to be an artist in the way I have taught myself how to be. The foundation of Application as Artwork is centered around my submitted application to The Printer Matter Publisher Work Grant. The grant states it acknowledges awardees’ accomplishments in past work and provid[es] the capacity-building funds to enable future book projects and publisher sustainability. This is the first grant I have applied to in almost 10 years of running GenderFail. By publishing my application as a fine art publication, I am nearly ensuring that my countless hours of work on this application result in some funding for purchasing this publication. In addition, 25% of the proceeds from this book will be donated to other publishers who were rejected by The Printer Matter Publisher Work Grant. I also want to add that the grant winners have not been announced as of the time of this post's publication. While working on this grant, I realized that the application mainly asked questions that might be useful to other working-class publishers, artists, and writers who are desperately trying to make a living in our hellish capitalist nightmare.

This publication also features the 4th edition featured section showing seven curated GenderFail Archive Project reading lists from Publishing Now, a class I taught from 2021-2023 at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University. For this course, I wanted the students to read zines and publications being produced in real-time, so I started to digitize my collection as I acquired specific titles that I felt the students would resonate with. Many of the readings for this course were scanned from my collection of over 2,000 zines, artist books, and art books that make up the GenderFail archive. Since we could not meet in person (due to the pandemic), I spent hours scanning zines and artist books to be used as required readings for the course. Each reading list will accompany a link and QR code to read and engage with the complete scanned copies of all 31 featured artist books, art books, and zines. The Imperfect Archiving, Archiving as Practice: Queer Bibliographic Explorations, is among my most cherished project I’ve published of the over 125 editions I’ve designed and printed with GenderFail.",2024,Be Oakley,"40.7128, -74.0060",North America,Global North,https://genderfailpress.info/Imperfect-Archiving-Archiving-as-Practice-Queer-Bibliographic
GenderFail,Boredom: An Anti-Capitalist Tool ,"This essay is broken into fragments of thoughts broadly centered around boredom as a revolutionary and anti-capitalist tool. This essay asks the following questions, including but not limited to: Boredom as a tool for the working class? Do working-class people have time to be bored? What does working-class Boredom look like?",2024,Be Oakley,"40.7128, -74.0060",North America,Global North,https://genderfailpress.info/Boredom-an-anti-capitalist-tool
GenderFail,Stonewall was a Riot Against Police Brutality: On Whitewashing and Queer Resistance,"Stonewall was a Riot Against Police Brutality is a reprint of our 2018 essay, Stonewall was a Riot, with three forwards: one written in the first few days of June 2020, the other in October 2020, and the most recent in September 2022. This publication looks at the role of whiteness and capitalism in the legacy of Stonewall. Oakley looks at the yearly gay pride event and examines how large corporations and police presence undermined the Stonewall Riots. Black trans and queer people took a stance against police aggression. In this current moment of the attempt of conservative people trying to censor queer and trans history, publications like this expanding on the legacy of Stonewall for future generations are paramount. From the forward, Oakley states, We need to remember that Stonewall was a riot against police brutality. As queer, trans, and non-binary people, 2020 pride month can’t just be about a casual celebration of our identity. This month (like every month, for that matter) must focus on addressing the intersections of our collective oppression that is rooted in white supremacy, heteronormativity, and colonialism. This month, we need to continue to honor and demand justice for George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and everyone murdered by our white supremacist police state. As queer, trans, and non-binary people, we need to stand in solidarity and action in our refusal to join the status quo. We need to stay fucking mad and protest, donate, and coalition build with each other to actively work towards the dismantling of our white supremacist police state. Pride 2020 is not a time for celebration; it is a time to show solidarity with cis, trans, and non-binary Black people.",2024,Be Oakley,"40.7128, -74.0060",North America,Global North,https://genderfailpress.info/Stonewall-was-a-Riot-Against-Police-Brutality-On-Whitewashing-and

Gravitron,Trans Feminist Self Help Zine,"This zine, the first in a series, seeks to specifically unpack the ways in which the medical-industrial complex can control, steal, and ultimately destroy trans people’s bodies, body image, and comfortable embodiments. This is not to say that transition care destroys our bodies—quite the opposite—it frees them. However, the system behind that care can do incredible harm through gatekeeping practices and a lack of bodily and embodied autonomy embedded in many trans and transition healthcare settings.",2022,Cat Haines,,North America,Global North,https://gravitrongravitron.org/publishing/p/trans-feminist-self-help-zine-volume-0

Gravitron,For Now You Had To Be There,"In this series of linked texts, artist Simon Fuh opens up spaces which the past inhabits and observes the structures it creates as pieces of time flake and gather. Written within the slipstream of recollection, these texts harness the fuzziness and digressions that come with remembering. Each piece is a collection of memories nested within memories which use the method of loci (also known as a memory palace) as both a potent metaphor and a tool for conjuring the affect of social memory. In For Now You Had To Be There, Fuh knots together parties, music, theory, artworks and fragmented conversations to probe the messiness of remembering together.",2022,Simon Fuh,,North America,Global North,https://gravitrongravitron.org/publishing/p/for-now-you-had-to-be-there

Half Letter Press,How Much Is Enough? Kate O' Shea & The Just City Residency: Reflections on an Embedded Practice at the Intersection of Art and Activism,"This booklet traces the richness and diversity of artist Kate O'Shea's response to the Just City Counter Narrative Neighbourhood award 2020 - 2022. The residency—located in studio 468 and supported by Common Ground—was bolstered by a wide range of established community development organizations with a vibrant history of community-based cultural practice. Featuring contributions from Dr Karen E. Till, Dr Krini Kafiris & Dr Eve Olney of The Radical Institute, and John Bissett, this publication provides a vital primer for the role of the artist in place at a critical juncture of social change and the conditions needed to support collaborative art practice. ""In the early days of the pandemic, Kate O' Shea established The Just City Collective. The group was formed initially as a reading group that met online weekly. It brought together community workers, artists, activists, and researchers from around the world exploring ideas and practices around spatial injustices in multiple cities. The reading group continued for 36 weeks. Different formations of this ecosystem became regular Yoga classes, dance classes, gatherings, the collaborative Halfway to Falling and inter-connected events Networks of Solidarity. Members of the collective continue to work collaboratively together.""",2023,"Siobhán Georghegan and Catherine Marshall, Karen E.

Half Letter Press,Another Century of Chemical Warfare,"This booklet was created during ICE's currently ongoing occupation of Chicago, where they are regularly deploying tear gas and other forms of chemical warfare in our neighborhoods. Another Century of Chemical Warfare reflects on the present, with writing about Chicago events of October 2025, accompanied by World War I era archival photos dealing with protection from chemical weapons and the development of chemical warfare in the US. It’s mid-October 2025 in Chicago. ICE agents are showing up in neighborhoods all over the city and in the suburbs. Sometimes helicopters and drones scope out an area a couple days before and then the ground goons arrive. Every day they grab fresh victims, shove them into vans, trucks and SUVs and take them to detention centers. They’ve zip-tied naked children. They’ve tear gassed and fired pepper balls at peaceful protesters, citizens trying to protect their neighbors, and journalists. Even unprepared Chicago police officers have been tear gassed. In a city that has one of the highest asthma rates in the country, where African American and Latinx families living in Chicago’s south and west side neighborhoods bear the brunt of hospitalizations, federal agents are using chemical weapons against us and hitting some of the most vulnerable the hardest. This publication shares examples from a collection of unrestricted World War I era archive photos from The National Archives at College Park, Maryland. The collection covers the development of chemical warfare and protection against it. I reviewed over 2,000 photos to make selections for this booklet. All are dated as having been received between 1918 and 1920. Over a century has passed and we are still determined to destroy people’s health with chemical weapons. Now our enemy is Immigration and Customs Enforcement; our tax dollars fund their gear and weapons. We are paying them to poison us.",2025,Marc Fischer,,North America,Global North,https://halfletterpress.com/another-century-of-chemical-warfare/
Half Letter Press,Street-Food Portfolio,"A sensitive booklet (the 8th from this collective) with many lovely drawings by Robby Herbst, Mehek Mehra, Olivia Russell and Georgia Witchel celebrating the vibrant street food of Los Angeles, and the vendors whose lives are increasingly under threat as ICE steps up their kidnappings and deportations in this city. Los Angeles is an unequal city of work. Work, most of us have to do it. But the nature of Angelinos’ work is differentiated by the many industries and services coloring the immense landscape. Street-food makes us common; standing on a corner together, delighting in low-cost cuisine, bathed in the city’s cool night air. Llano Del Rio’s new Street-Food Portfolio doesn’t represent the totality of LA’s street-food scene, but provides a view of it.

Handshake Studio,Fang,"Fang is a personal visual exploration of the power of place in rousing trauma, stemming from the artist’s experience of being trapped in Catarroja, Valencia, during the DANA floods of October 29, 2024. Surrounded by violent waters on a small mound in a field with no help in sight, she mentally mapped countless escape routes—each ultimately impossible to take. In the months that followed, while mudlarking through altered streets for supplies, she confronted flashbulb memories; the remnants of both the disaster and what had become a futile imagined path to safety. Fang examines the interplay of trauma, memory, and reconstruction, using image-making as a way to see and process anew. It does not document the flood itself but rather the psychological and emotional terrain left in its wake—an attempt to reconcile what was imagined with what remains, and to expose the absence of aid for hundreds of thousands of Valencians who on that day and in the months to follow were left without warning, help or salvation.",2025,Freya Brook Verona Copeland,,Europe,Global North,https://handshake.fun/Fang

Today, the imagery surrounding this road is far removed from the optimistic fascination of the 1970s, and the landscapes and architectures along the way evoke a sense of strangeness.

We are in a territory that has been transformed in the last 50 years. If the water has traditionally been used for irrigating orchards, the trend in recent decades has been to use it also for private enjoyment.

Homie House Press,Future Fire,"Future Fires invites us to collectively investigate the harm we can no longer live within and to consider what must burn down in order to build beyond the cultural framework of white supremacy that we are all born into. The images and texts presented here were created, printed, and bound in the Spring 2025 collaboration between Homie House Press and George Mason School of Art’s Dynamic Publishing program. Future Fires takes its name and derives its ethos from prophet, icon, and teacher, James Baldwin and his book, The Fire Next Time (1963), in which he writes, If we—and I mean the relatively conscious whites and the relatively conscious black, who must, like lovers, insist on, or create, the consciousness of others—do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world. James Baldwin was born on August 2, 1924; here, we honor his singular voice and celebrate his centennial year. This work reaches back and pulls forward from publications and collaborators across two previous Homie House Press projects, Femme Frontera (2018), and First Fronteras (2019), in which we revisited the past through fluid migration and embodied ancestral histories. Here, we face the chaos of the current moment and stare into the fires all around us, telling uncomfortable truths in authentic and poetic ways to speak meaning and change into being.",2025,George Mason University’s Spring 2025 Dynamic Publishing Class,,North America,Global North,https://www.adrianastories.com/new-products/future-fire

Homie House Press,(Not) in Service,"(Not) In Service is the second publication by Uni Q. Mical.

This project includes photographs from Baltimore native, Iya Simone, along with Uni’s family archived albums, google map images, and finally, some background images by our own, hhp native, Adriana Monsalve. (Not) in Service is a chronicle of poetry written from 2017-2022, during a transitional period of Unique’s life in her late 20s-early 30s. Many of the poems were written while Unique was in transit on Baltimore’s public transportation, which she counted on for her entire life up until 2022 (when she officially became a motorist). Baltimore’s transit system, known locally as the MTA (Maryland Transit Administration), is a steady, yet often unpredictable system of buses, subway trains, and light rails, which close to 2 million commuters relied upon in 2022 alone. The title of the zine, (Not) in Service, is derived from the MTA bus marquee in Unique’s youth, which frequently frustrated commuters who stood for lengthy time frames. This project is meant to portray an unflinching, eyewitness account of the city Unique calls home, and a vulnerable disclosure of her emotional spectrum in this transitory period. Moreover, the collection speaks to Unique’s artistic mission to shift the international narrative of Baltimore City, focusing on glimpses of moments often overshadowed by tales of violence and destruction.",2023,Uni Q.

Humboldt Books,Mosca 1962,"In the summer of 1962, while still a university student of architecture, Andrea Branzi went to visit his brother Piergiorgio in Moscow, where he was working as a Rai correspondent. This was the world of the Cold War, but the ‘thaw’ heralded by Nikita Khrushchev had somewhat loosened the grip of the Soviet regime. The young Branzi took the chance to wander around the city, exploring it from top to bottom. With a curiosity for everything, he was struck by the immense size of the capital, by its new neighbourhoods, by the signs of communism and its history, by the omnipresence of the military, but also by the relaxed outlook of the youth, the department stores, the Russians’ carefree relationship with nature, the innocence of the children and the widespread love of chess. What emerges is the portrait of a population markedly different from our own, yet one with which a shared future might be imagined. In the images from this youthful journey, we may perhaps glimpse a number of elements that would later emerge of Branzi the ‘utopian’ designer and thinker. Andrea Branzi’s photographic reportage is accompanied by texts by Gian Piero Piretto and Angela Rui.",2025,Andrea Branzi,,Europe,Global North,https://www.humboldtbooks.com/en/book/mosca-1962
Humboldt Books,Yemen 1979,"Some people go around constantly comparing their own experience and culture with what they see: I take the opposite attitude, I let myself go before what I see, I let myself get involved, especially in the landscape and its transformation. This is how Marco Zanuso describes his way of travelling. The Milanese architect travelled the world for work at a time when few people did, but he maintained the pleasure of discovery intact even on his private journeys, during which he would take photographs. This is what happened on a family trip to a Yemen not yet touched by tourism. The curiosity of the architect’s gaze is conveyed through the magnificent black and white of the photographs of the walls of Sana'a, of the great towers made of dried mud bricks, as well as of the construction details or the customs of the local population. The texts by Maria Pace Ottieri and Franco Raggi focus on his human and professional qualities, painting a portrait of one of the great architects and designers of the twentieth century.",2025,Marco Zanuso,,Europe,Global North,https://www.humboldtbooks.com/en/book/yemen-1979
Humboldt Books,Analogous Jerusalem,"Jerusalem is not just a city; it’s an idea. For millennia, it has been frequented by visitors of all faiths and social classes seeking to interact with its sanctity, entailing cycles of violent battles for its control, catalysing the need to relocate the idea of Jerusalem to places far from its physical boundaries. ‘Analogous Jerusalem’ is a five-year photographic journey exploring these ‘analogous’ shrines in various landscapes, capturing the continuous topography of pilgrimage with elements belonging to mutually exclusive categories: the sacred and the profane. A three-part essay explores the translation of the sacred sites from Jerusalem to Europe, the rituals of virtual pilgrimage common among mediaeval nuns and the history of photographic journeys. Together, the images and text construct a travelogue through places that are perhaps more ‘real’ than Jerusalem itself.",2025,Gili Merin,,Europe,Global North,https://www.humboldtbooks.com/en/book/analogous-jerusalem
Humboldt Books,A War Play,"A War Play is a project by Giulio Squillacciotti that investigates the representation of war and its staging. The project stems from a stereoscopic image by the painter Giuseppe Augusto Levis (1879–1926) from a series of works dedicated to the historical depiction of the First World War. Levis constructed tableaux vivants using peasants from the local area (Piedmont), hired for the occasion. Squillacciotti works on the re-temporalisation of the work in the contemporary context, adding further layers to the staging. The book traces the project from a theoretical-narrative perspective, bringing together the contributions of the curators, ARTECO and CRIPTA747, as well as researchers Vittoria Martini and Kamil Dalkir, who question the extent to which visual constructions may influence the viewer’s perception and interpretation, pre-empting and sometimes subverting the veracity of the narration.",2025,Giulio Squillacciotti,,Europe,Global North,https://www.humboldtbooks.com/en/book/a-war-play
Humboldt Books,The Aquarium is a Listening Glass,"When used as a listening instrument, a glass is no longer a mere container. By amplifying sounds and voices through a surface, it becomes a conduit between two seemingly distant environments. Like a glass, aquarium walls implement a material and ontological separation between human and marine creatures, highlighting the relationship we have established over time with these living beings, transformed into taxonomical units. In The Aquarium is a Listening Glass, nine short, non-linear stories – set amid scientific archives, underwater research stations, natural history museums, national aquaria and oceanic infrastructure – evoke the glass as a listening device to present singular relationships between humans and fish that would otherwise go unheard. In this paradigm shift, design plays a fundamental role in conceiving the object (and the book) as a sensory device to glimpse new forms of mediation, to generate alliances, and also to promote the potential for a thriving and vital world.",2024,"Louise E. Carver, Angela Rui",,Europe,Global North,https://www.humboldtbooks.com/en/book/the-aquarium-is-a-listening-glass
Humboldt Books,Ministry of Loneliness,"Published together with the Fondazione ICA Milano, Ministry of Loneliness reproduces and expands on the research that Rebecca Moccia presented on the occasion of the exhibition of the same name. Departing from the exploration of the Ministry of Loneliness – established in 2018 in the United Kingdom and replicated in 2021 in other countries such as Canada and Japan – the artist’s work develops a reflection on the political and social structures that shape the emotional state of loneliness and its perception in contemporary society. In the project, which stems from a research trip unfolding between Italy, the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom, the phantasmal and pervasive shadow of isolation that permeates Western societies takes shape in a layered investigation extending to the very roots that trigger it: from the advancement of the techno-scientific order of modern life to the rise of liberal capitalism. The volume reproduces the collection of notes that formed the basis of Moccia’s project in its entirety – a digital collage with diary-like traits, consisting of texts, images, reports and reflections on various kinds of documents. The critical texts by Chiara Nuzzi – curator of the exhibition – and Vincenzo Estremo broaden Rebecca Moccia’s work on a theoretical level, highlighting how between loneliness and individualisation there lies a dialectical relationship inextricably bound up in the modes of late-capitalist production.",2023,Rebecca Moccia,,Europe,Global North,https://www.humboldtbooks.com/en/book/ministry-of-loneliness
Humboldt Books,SADAK Hand painted street signs in India,"Since the 1990s, hand-painted signs in India – one of the defining elements of the country’s urban landscape – have been largely replaced by more technologically advanced media. Today, they survive in a vernacular culture quite distinct from largescale digital productions. The work of the sign-painters represents a visual itinerary through the historical-economic changes of Indian society over the years; paintings that emerge in vivid shapes and colours and humanise the sharp aesthetics of the subjects and objects of globalised capitalism. The book showcases a part of artist Aradhana Seth’s photographic archive: a multitude of designs on shop shutters, doors, signs and the walls of various places of interest and businesses. Produced over the past few decades, the images are split into three thematic sections: commerce and services, culture, and nature and landscape. Complementing the publication are biographies of Raza Abbas, Praveen Chauan, Prashant Janardhan Dalvi and Shakeel, just some of the artists who created the paintings photographed; a critical text by visual culture lecturer Kajri Jain, outlining the theoretical framework within which to interpret these visual forms, as well as an autobiographical text by artist Francesco Clemente.",2023,Aradhana Seth,,Europe,Global North,https://www.humboldtbooks.com/en/book/sadak-hand-painted-street-signs-in-india
Humboldt Books,From Here to Tibet. A conversation between two walking artists. March 2019 – July 2020,"For more than twenty-five years, the artists Hamish Fulton and Michael Höpfner have shared ideas and reflections on art and walking as an independent artistic practice. Over the course of time, they have exchanged countless emails, letters and postcards from the placed they have visited, keeping their dialogue alive even over great distances. In 2015, while working together on a show at the Museo MAN in Nuoro, they had the idea of bringing together their correspondence exploring the thoughts they had exchanged on art, the landscape as well as on the aesthetic and political aspects of walking itself.
As the title suggests, From Here to Tibet revolves around the deep fascination that the two artists have with the territory and culture of the Tibetan people: for both, walking and making art in Tibet turned out to be an experience that would change their lives and which in various ways has influenced their careers, their way of thinking and their artistic production.
For the reader, this conversation winds like a path, and outlines walking as an art form, attempting to couch it within art history, dwelling on its social and political implications right up to the days of the pandemic.",2022,"Hamish Fulton, Michael Höpfner",,Europe,Global North,https://www.humboldtbooks.com/en/book/from-here-to-tibet-a-conversation-between-two-walking-artists-march-2019-july-2020

Project of a Historical Architecture,"On 26 July 1721 the Wiener Diarium informed its readers that a new book by the general surveyor of constructions, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, titled Entwurff Einer Historischen Architectur, was ready for subscribers to collect from the architect’s place. The Entwurff is a collection of 86 sheets illustrating the architecture of the Jews, Egyptians, Syrians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Turks, Siamese, Chinese and Japanese, along with some of the author's projects. Upon the third centenary of the author’s death this re-print proposes to look back at Fischer’s book as a precise cultural project, reacting to a specific historical and geographical context, and yet suggesting a more general attitude that can challenge contemporary architecture as well. The volume is accompanied by a complete translation of the original texts and complemented with essays by Maarten Delbeke, Steven Lauritano and Pier Paolo Tamburelli.",2024,"Maarten Delbeke, Pier Paolo Tamburelli",,Europe,Global North,https://www.humboldtbooks.com/en/book/johann-bernhard-fischer-von-erlach-project-of-a-historical-architecture

HumDrum Press,"The Colonial, Familiar, Nostalgic, Radical, Transformative Life of the Strawberry","The story of the strawberry is troubled.Troubled because of what becomes uncovered as we unpick the systems within which this sweet, nostalgic fruit is embedded within. From rural English fruit-picking sites, to agricultural fields in Spain, to the sides of North American highways, the strawberry exists in many formations. Its multiple (his)stories—starting from its hybrid colonial roots, trace the many hands that have encountered this fruit on its journey into our mouths, its avid consumer. The Colonial, Familiar, Nostalgic, Radical, Transformative Life of the Strawberry encompasses the stories and histories that shape the human relations that are entangled with the strawberry. It unpacks the abstractions between the fruit and the exploitation often overlooked within its production, to explore how, through varied social, political, geographic and economic contexts, the story of the strawberry lives on through all of our hands, mouths, and memories.",2024,Marika Vandekraats,,Europe,Global North,"https://humdrumpress.com/the-colonial,-familiar,-nostalgic,-radical,-transformative-life-of-the-strawberry"

What if we start to understand love not as something that happens to us, but also as something that we can actively exercise? What would a collective practice of love towards Ourselves, Other/s, and Other Other/s then look like? How to Love Many in Many Ways is an expanded artistic research project, initiated by Engy Mohsen and Gabriel Hensche in collaboration with nine invited artists and researchers, that takes the form of a set of games and exercises that playfully challenge the way we see and practice love and with whom we share it. For this publication the authors of the games and exercises explore the connections, encounters, concepts, and objects that stimulated the development of their individual games, in the form of a love story, intertwined with reference materials and processes that helped shape their contributions.

China, rapidly changing since its economic liberalization, Korea, still a divided nation in the age of globalization, and Japan, often called the West of East Asia, are subjects familiar to us, yet also clichés. Through these images, long-accumulated and fixed from the outside, we encounter the past and present, sometimes developing mutual understanding and sometimes distorted prejudice. Among these

Sutherland's photographs of deer invading the city from the wild, and Stephen Gill's Hackney Flower Project, a sentimental reimagining of London's Hackney district, evoke humanity's longing for nature, a place sometimes called Eden. Conversely, Korean artist Yong Hun Lee's toy deer resemble taxidermy, obliterated by the destruction of nature, while Thomas Ruff's works appear even more artificial due to their pixelated grid. Finally, Korean artist Jungjoo Kim's images, presented through drawings, objects, and photographs, recreate the mechanical and cold ironwork of the city.",1000,,"37.5503, 126.9971",East Asia,Global North,https://www.iannmagazine.com/?p=402

IANN,IANN vol.5 Growing Up,"Youth exists only when its presence is problematic or seen as a problem. – Dick Hebdige, researcher of youth subcultures. There's a subtle difference between the words growing up and maturity. Generally, growing up refers to the process of progressing through continuous change, often referred to as self-formation. Maturity, on the other hand, refers to self-realization, the maturation of that change into completion. If we understand teenagers as physically and mentally unfinished, they are inevitably seen as growing up, unstable or ambiguous. Consequently, their provocative struggles with overflowing talent and individuality—their provocative transformations—can easily be limited or censored, often under the pretext of a lack of identity. But what is the true standard for measuring growth and maturity?
As Dick Hebdige suggests, when we remove our narrow-minded perspectives from them, what will teenagers be like to us?",1000,,"37.5503, 126.9971",East Asia,Global North,https://www.iannmagazine.com/?p=81

What began as a private act of mourning — for her late father and in response to the ongoing occupation of Palestine — evolved into a powerful tapestry of memory, resistance, and ancestral love. Through intimate, unflinching verse, Mo’alla explores themes of exile, inherited grief, language loss, and the enduring spirit of Palestinian sumud (steadfastness). These letters to Baba are as much about personal loss as they are about collective survival — asserting Palestinian existence in the face of attempted erasure.

Illographo Press,From Baybayin to Abakada,"A multilayered zine written, researched and designed by Filipino-born creative Reese Claro and published by Illographo Press. In this zine, Reese weaves childhood memories from growing up in the Phillipines, personal anecdotes as a first generation migrant in Australia, and historical documents to illustrate the impact of colonisation on the culture, vernacular, and way of life of the Filipino people and diaspora. From Baybayin to Abakada is a tri-lingual publication divided into three sections: the Pre-colonial Philippines (Baybayin), the Spanish Rule (Abecedario/Español), and the Post-American Colonisation of the Philippines (Abakada/Tagalog); based on the ruling power and the main writing systems used in the Philippines during that period.",2025,Reese Claro,,Oceania,Global North,https://aphrodited.info/illographo-press
Illographo Press,Aesthetics of Longing,"A collection of photographs byproducts of flaneuring-wandering around-through the Balkans between 2009-2014. Through the lens of his 35mm film and digital cameras, Nikola takes us on a pilgrimage from his birthplace of Knin to the streets of Serbia’s capital city-Belgrade; from the war-torn province of Kosovo and Metohija to the warm seas of Boka Bay in Montenegro. Aesthetics of Longing gives a rare and genuine insight into the elusive past of Former Yugoslavia and the persistent melancholy in the hearts and minds of the Yugoslav diaspora. Nikola’s photographs are raw, unfiltered and seeping with nostalgia. His stories are imbued by a sentimental longing for a time and a place that no longer exists - a collective emotion that connects millions of displaced refugees and migrants from all over the world.",2024,Nikola Amanovic,,Oceania,Global North,https://aphrodited.info/illographo-press

Incendium Radical Library Press,"Solidarity, trauma and internal limits to struggle","During the recent and ongoing violent occupation of Palestine many of us have been drawn to or engaged in various solidarity actions. We have been trying, failing, asking, examining and learning about what solidarity might mean. At the same time, we are witnessing the violent deaths of so many. Organising within and alongside the context of violence and trauma has raised tensions and exposed internal limits. Too often, across different organising spaces and actions, collectives and radical organisations have collapsed after grappling with these limits - oftentimes around interpersonal conflict and harm. We would like to offer the following compilation of readings as a way to explore these tensions, as well as what a principled practice of addressing harm and conflict in struggle might look like within a shared politic and across difference. We hope that they can spark conversations within your groups and collectives. This project was created on the stolen land of the Wurundjeri & Boon Wurrung/Bunurong peoples of the Kulin Nation.

Incendium Radical Library Press,When Grief Arrives,"An oral history of grief and death within queer, trans and / or black, indigenous and people of color communities. The idea for this book came from my personal experiences with the death of loved ones. I wanted to make space for a deeper inquiry into how queer, trans and/or black, Indigenous, people of colour communities are responding to death, navigating grieving and persisting amidst pain and hardship. Philippe - my pa - died in May of 2020. He was a brown man who experienced a lot of suffering and injustices in his life and he died young. Whilst I do not want to reduce the aliveness of my pa’s life or diminish his life into his dying, I also do not want to soften that he died a premature black and working class death. My pa died during the covid-19 lockdowns and due to restrictions his last days were with immediate family and friends and his funeral had attendance limits. We went into another lockdown in July of 2020 and it was a time of profound solitude in grieving. My close friend Alex died in March of 2023. A group of us found out he had overdosed when we were down the coast together on Gadubanud Country. Close friends and I organised for loved ones, comrades and family to be together the Friday of that week. We shared photos, memories, ate together, cried, made space for rage - which there was a lot of, sadness, love, connection and care. Contrasted to what happened when my pa died, it was a remarkably different and healing experience for me. When grief arrives comprises eleven narratives of tragic deaths ranging from overdose and suicide to murder, rare conditions, chronic illness and working class death. These deaths are often attributed to manifestations of capitalism, and its related institutions of violence including white supremacy, the prison-industrial complex, cisheteropatriarchy and colonialism. Tragic deaths are different to death that is part of life through aging. Death as part of living can be meaningful and dignified, whereas tragic deaths are difficult to respond to. Reflecting on these tragic deaths prompts us to question which lives society deems worthy of grieving and what defines a grievable life. Here, on this continent, Aboriginal deaths are hidden, excluded from public grieving as Indigenous people are dehumanised. Similarly, in occupied Palestine, settler violence dictates who matters and who is disposable. Shaped by rich traditions and histories which situate communities as sites of justice and healing, the stories inside stand in stark contrast to the prevailing neoliberal, individualised and normative responses to grief. They are examples of people collaboratively building and sharing resources and envisioning creative approaches to the complexities of grieving. When grief arrives also connects with movement histories that actively contribute to ongoing liberation struggles. The project utilises oral histories as a means to narrate stories, challenge the idea of expert and create an archive based in community knowledges. My hope for these stories is that friends, family, and communities can offer those experiencing grief with an alternative perspective of themselves and their loved ones who have died, rather than just the experiences of the hardships and struggles they are facing. When grief arrives took place on the stolen lands of the Wurundjeri & Boon Wurrung/Bunurong peoples of the Kulin Nation. Sovereignty was never ceded and this is and always will be Aboriginal land.

Insititute of Critical Zoologists,"New Forest 1, A History of Cows
","New Forest 1, A History of Cows is an artist book by Robert Zhao Renhui and the Institute of Critical Zoologists. In 1935, a herd of feral cattle was spotted roaming Singapore. Since then, alleged sightings have been rare. Reports came mainly from Japanese soldiers in World War II and occasionally from local residents. If these reports are true, these cows were confined to the areas of Tampines, Punggol, Sembawang and Pulau Ubin. In 2016, a cow was discovered on Coney Island but died shortly after. Some believe that wild cows still roam Singapore. The first volume is dedicated to the last cow in Singapore, which died in 2016. The book contains images of the cow just before it passed away. Conceived by The Institute of Critical Zoologists between 2014 and 2019, this book features images of cows in Singapore from the 1890s to 2016 from ICZ's archive.",2020,Robert Zhao Renhui,"1.3521, 103.8198",Southeast Asia,Global North,https://www.criticalzoologists.org/journal.html
Insititute of Critical Zoologists,"Singapore, Very Old Tree","Singapore is often known as a Garden City, but this is an impersonal image of anonymous trees and gardeners. Our project aims to boil this generic image down to specifics by exploring the concrete, personal connections that Singaporeans have made with trees. After all, what is loving nature without loving the individual plant? Through our interviews, we found that people relate to plants in touching and occasionally surprising ways. For example, a group of Buddhists have been circling a rubber tree for an hour a day, for the past few years, as a form of walking meditation and to absorb the tree’s energy. A mangosteen tree has been sheltering a man for 20 years, since he saved it from the bulldozers. Another woman cries when her trees don’t fruit. Besides featuring in individual stories, trees are living, breathing markers of history. The trees in our collection are of different ages. Some are old native species from pre-colonial times, when Singapore was mostly a freshwater swamp forest; others are younger trees that their owners planted from seeds. The images in the project are influenced by vintage hand-tinted Singapore postcards. In fact, Singapore, very old tree is named after the title of one of the oldest postcards in the National Archive, a 1904 picture of an unspecified tree. The project consists of a total of 30 trees.

The Invisible Archive,Krista Papista,"how does artist Krista Papista re-invent folklore and imagine a new culture? I am particularly intrigued by this question and topic because I am a musician myself in the contemporary landscape, and find resonance with artists who seek to break away from typical genres and create their own. I enjoyed the idea of eliminating the haunting origins of folklore, and found this topic to be very original and innovative. a self-reflexive writing by the author Miriam Gatt whose emotive engagement with the work of  Cypriot-based music artist Krista Papista is articulated partly through first person narrative, and partly through analysis using the thinking of other artists, such as David Wojnarowicz who is cited by Papista and poet Elena Toumazi-Rembelina. The use of the term Fucklore is a provocation, an attempt to transgress the traditional Folklore ideals for representing Cypriot culture. [Miriam] argues that Papista generates political and anarchic performances by twisting sounds, aesthetics, and ceremonies from Cypriot, Balkan, and Eastern Mediterranean traditions as the essay seeks to expound on the possibility of resistance that can derive from experimental music.",2025,Miriam Gatt,"52.5200, 13.4050",Europe,Global North,https://www.invisiblearchive.com/krista-papista
The Invisible Archive,Nodeul School for the Disabled,"During Paolo Caffoni and Yon Natalie Mik’s conversation at Nodeul, they experience several crises of an ableist society where algorithms used to perform speech analysis fail their effectiveness, and time and labor refuse capitalistic equations towards production. Politics of care are the grounding values of the community. Is Crip’s life revolutionary? This is a powerful question, and whether the author does not directly pose it is the only question I can take out after reading the text. And it is coming with nuances: why does capitalistic-centric society disable the disabled? Why do we have so little recognition of experiences where Crip leadership and self-organization are allowed and celebrated? Is it because there is a radical refusal of the equation labor-production? Does this refusal disempower the necrocapitalist dimension? Is Crip’s leadership necessarily abolitionist? This text is a pleasure to read, simultaneously honest and sharp in offering a portrait that does not allow space for stereotypical representation of disabled activism. It is a needed paper. We need some billion pages of authors celebrating the radical existence of disabled life. Would this bend the Large Language Models? But if only one disabled voice fuck-up the most sophisticated algorithm of language analyses, what do we need?

The Invisible Archive,Annie Sprinkle & Beth Stephens,"The topics of ecosexuality and the roles queer love plays in lineages of art-making are generally under-documented. Add to this the thread of sex-positive feminism and sex worker’s rights, and this essay feels excitingly original. Vogel describes Sprinkle and Stephens’ work in the context of the community that grows up and through them, in a movement towards a relational form of art making. The lines we traditionally draw between activism, high culture, and community work make it hard to discuss this kind of practice, but I think Vogel does a great job. The writing is clear, compelling, and well-structured. The style is sensuous and paints a vivid picture, reusing imagery and symbolism coherently throughout the text. Vogel is admirably reflexive too, examining her own impulses in light of what she has learned from the artists she is documenting. The discussions of conflict within the creative process, with our own habits, and with external forces, were interesting to read about. Like the natural processes the artists center in their work, the conflicts and resolutions of practicing making together, produce the most resilient and beloved fruit. The interview is a fantastic addition. I enjoyed seeing how, because of the depth of their connection, Stephens is able to speak about Sprinkle, and vice versa, in a way they would likely not speak about themselves. It’s a fun ‘proof of theory’ to read in real-time as they converse. They are each other’s cheerleaders. They mediate between their beloved collaborator and the world they inhabit with skill and compassion. I particularly appreciated the discussion on authorship. I’d never heard an artist admit to authoring their ideas while having sex. Their organic and collaborative methodology is drawn in stark contrast to the way in which their work was often falsely attributed to the more famous author (Sprinkle). Their discussion on the topic gives valuable insight into the push and pull of internal and external effects in an artistic process. Through their committed connection to their community, planet, and one another, and by doggedly documenting and disseminating their work, Stephens and Sprinkle have done the seemingly impossible: told their own trailblazing story. Or, at least, this essay presents a gorgeously succinct narration thereof. Their deep and serious commitment to relational practice quickly mows down the demeaning labels first lobbed at them. By centering the work, and the communities of practice behind it, they’ve contributed a new way of understanding love and nature while upending the dominant cultural understanding of what whores and hillbillys are capable of.

Lara’s making sense of Prima stands in comparison to Prima’s making sense of their transnational identity, history, and be/longing.

The Invisible Archive,Francis and Anthony Almendárez: Navigating the Archives Within,"The essay probes at the tension of misrecognition and recognition by mainstream American popular (Americana) media from the perspective of Latinx immigrant experiences. It locates this tension within a set of autobiographical readings that oscillate between resistance and assimilation, from adult children of immigrants from Mexico and Honduras. This unique social position is occupied by both the author of the essay as well as the Almendárez brothers’, the creators of Navigating the Archives Within. This critical positionality creates an interesting crossfade of dominant American pop-cultural texts between their immigrants’ parents’ escapist reading of American pop culture vs. their own critical, academic analysis. The crossing adds nuanced textures to the discussion about inter-generational longing for mainstream societal connection among BIPOC immigrants in the United States.",2022,Virginia Arce,"52.5200, 13.4050",Europe,Global North,https://www.invisiblearchive.com/francis-and-anthony-almendarez

The central question, of how language might be harnessed to center someone’s life in their story, is originally handled by the author’s dynamic deconstruction of the obituary genre […] I took much pleasure in this conceit, and welcomed both the author’s narration of a personal connection to Camille, which felt tender and authentic; and the electric, alive quality of their prose (echoing O’Grady’s own kinetic energy).

iwalewabooks,The Shit and the Sunrise,"Borrowing its title from Wura-Natasha Ogunji's poignant work, The Shit and the Sunrise invites us into the dynamic and ever moving heart of Lagos, and Nigeria as a whole. Through the lives and works of talented artists, we experience the space(s) through the chaotic combination of hope and despair. We engage with voices from Lagos, Abuja, and beyond, each negotiating the tension between dreaming and surviving under the weight of discrimination, sociopolitical inequality, and oppression. This anthology offers no easy answers; however, it provides honest reflections on what it means to exist where the ground is always shifting. You will encounter stories of resistance and resilience, of memories reclaimed, and of communities that refuse to be erased. Above all, these works remind us that in imperfection lies power, and that even in the most chaotic spaces, creativity can generate new possibilities.",2025,"Adebayo Quadry-Adekanbi, Ayodele Olofintuade",,Africa,Global South,https://www.iwalewabooks.com/product-page/the-shit-and-the-sunrise-1

iwalewabooks,Ethiopia: Modern Nation – Ancient Roots,"There is much in Ethiopia's cultural and political identity that contemporary audiences will find inspiring. For instance, while the colonial thesis argues that Africa is singularity the invention of European colonialism, the non-colonial thesis in Ethiopian scholarship sees Ethiopia through the lens of exceptionalism, that Ethiopia, which was never colonized, is in rather than of Africa. If African modernity and modernism are intimately linked with colonialism, certainly Ethiopia's inimitable historical condition merits fresh lines of inquiry to understand how Ethiopian negotiated their ""independent"" status quo through and against colonial arrangements that shaped the historical, cultural, and material realities of their African counterparts. One of this book's central contributions is, therefore, its conceptualization of how Ethiopia's singular colonial history can be analyzed in relation to the political thought that shaped African colonial history. Ethiopia's supposed singularity, as it particularly pertains to its modern history, cannot be conceived outside the broader colonial legacy and the complexity of meaning and making.",2025,"Dagmawi Woubshet, Elizabeth W.

Islam Aly,Harf,"Harf means letter in Arabic, highlighting the work’s focus on individual letterforms. The piece consists of two compartments. The first compartment contains an artist’s book that visually explores Kufic geometric script, one of the oldest and most architecturally structured forms of Arabic calligraphy. Each section of the book presents a single, letter rendered in a geometric Kufic form, celebrating the letter as both a linguistic symbol and a sculptural element. The book is composed of individually folded sections, with each folio featuring a different type of paper, including handmade sheets, decorated surfaces, and handwritten or textured varieties. This variation in material enhances the contrast between the crisp geometry of the letters and the rich tactile and visual qualities of the paper. The variation of paper types adds layers of meaning, emphasizing the uniqueness and rhythm of each letterform. At the same time, it evokes the historical layering of script and ornament found in Islamic manuscripts, drawing from traditional Islamic visual language while reinterpreting it through a contemporary lens. The use of papers reinforces the book’s material presence and highlights the elegance and expressive power of Kufic calligraphy as a visual art form. The second compartment contains laser-cut letterforms made of plexiglass, echoing the designs featured in the book. A stand is included, allowing viewers to interact with the letters, displaying them individually or arranging them into visually engaging compositions using the geometric forms.",2025,Islam Aly,"30.0444, 31.2357",Africa,Global South,https://www.islamaly.com/harf.html
Islam Aly,Kinship,"Kinship is an artist's book that delves into the relationship between colonial and colonized artifacts, exploring their cultural and historical context. The project underscores the significance of repatriation as a crucial measure for safeguarding cultural heritage. The project unfolds in various components, housed within a large box reminiscent of museum displays, featuring three distinct compartments. The initial section consists of a series of nested boxes, reminiscent of ancient Egyptian sarcophagi, culminating in a golden-covered box containing an ebony-covered book featuring quotes from The Tale of the Eloquent Peasant, a work dating back to the Middle Kingdom (2040-1750 BCE). This narrative depicts a peasant's plea to the Chief Steward of the crown after being robbed, addressing themes of social and divine justice.
 Accompanying the tale are ten hieroglyphic symbols representing, renewal, protection, prosperity, eternity,, infinity stability,  power protection, eternal life, wisdom, regeneration, and transition. The second part of the project presents slides featuring quotes expressing individuals' and institutions' reactions to the return of artifacts, emphasizing the importance of repatriation. On the back, a colonial map of Africa, one of the most looted continents, is displayed. In the third compartment, ten distinct hieroglyphic symbols are intricately cut into wood, creating negative spaces reminiscent of amulets found in ancient Egyptian tombs. Here, the absence of these amulets is portrayed rather than their presence, weaving a symbolic narrative within the artistic composition. Kinship aims to engage viewers in a reflective exploration of the intricate interplay between artifacts, their historical context, and the ethical considerations surrounding repatriation. The project seeks to foster a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical implications inherent in such endeavors",2024,Islam Aly,"30.0444, 31.2357",Africa,Global South,https://www.islamaly.com/kinship.html
Islam Aly,Mare Nostrum,"Mare Nostrum is a bilingual book in English and Arabic that highlights the Mediterranean Immigration Crisis; People from Sub-Saharan Africa, the middle and far East come to North Africa to cross the Mediterranean using primitive boats and with the help of traffickers of immigrants. According to the missing migrant project, more than 23600 missing migrants have been recorded in the Mediterranean since 2014. Mare Nostrum is a box with two compartments. On the left is a book with images of boats and quotes from migrants who survived the journey of crossing the Mediterranean, reflecting on their experiences. Nine quotes were taken from interviews and video clips where they discussed their experience. Images of the boats are derived from drawings of boats on pottery from predynastic Egypt. In ancient Egypt, boats were used for ceremonial purposes. Most importantly, taking the king's bodies from one side of the Nile to another, moving from their temporary life, and death to their afterlife and eternity. This is parallel to the immigrant's journey, moving from poverty and conflict to freedom and stability. The colors selected for the sections reflect the Mediterranean sea and the journey of the migrants alternating from light to dark blue and back to light as the journey progresses. The book allows the viewers to interact with the immigrant's journey. Five small circles are laser cut on each section. The brass boat bases fit into the circles allowing the viewer to move the boats within the page space, echoing the immigrants moving process in multiple combinations. Mare Nostrum, in Latin meaning: Our Sea, was the Roman name for the Mediterranean Sea. The Italian government also used Mare Nostrum for military and humanitarian operations to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers. Special thanks to my son, Mahmoud Islam, for suggesting the Latin Name.

Islam Aly,Delta,"The book Delta uses the symbol Δ to represent a change or difference in quantity between two values in mathematics and science. The term Delta also refers to Lower Egypt, where the Nile River delta is located. This delta is one of the world's largest, stretching from Alexandria to Port Said. However, rising sea levels put much of the northern delta, including the historic port city of Alexandria, at risk of being submerged in the Mediterranean. Delta highlights the global crisis of rising sea levels and its impact on deltas worldwide. It contains a descriptive poem for the Nile Delta by Nicholas Michell and features images of sea monsters from The Carta Marina by Olaus Magnus, initially published in 1539.  Sea monsters have been a part of human folklore for thousands of years and are often depicted in artwork and stories as symbols of danger and the unknown. These images serve as a reminder of the risks and uncertainties of the ocean and remain a symbol of the unknown. The contrast between the descriptive poem and the sea monsters underscores the gravity of the topic and its importance. Delta is enclosed in a box with two transparent sides that display laser-cut images. The front features an old map of the Nile Delta, and the back shows an old map of Alexandria port.",2023,Islam Aly,"30.0444, 31.2357",Africa,Global South,https://www.islamaly.com/delta.html
Islam Aly,Transpose,"Transpose is a bilingual book in English and Arabic that investigates talismanic shirts. A worn textile that was believed to offer protection and guidance to the carrier. Historically there were various uses for the talismanic shirts; they could be worn as a shield in battles, during illness, used as protective amulets, and produced for ceremonial purposes. They would have a distinctive vocabulary, a mixture of religious texts, sacred invocations, symbols, magic squares, and seal markings. In Transpose, seven pamphlets taking the shapes of shirts are designed and enclosed in the box. Each invokes a different wish: Power, Celebration, Magic, Prosperity, Affection, Peace, and Health. Transpose reveals how garments embed our backgrounds, experiences, decisions, and memories allowing us to live through each garment.  The book challenges the notion of power and privilege. Traditionally, these shirts were dedicated to the elite and kept protected in drawers and boxes. Transpose makes these wishes unrestricted for viewers to be rearranged and reordered in various ways according to their preference. After taking away all the pamphlets, the viewer can read a quote on the inner side of the box, emphasizing a greater meaning to each shirt. there is much to support the view that it is clothes that wear us and not we them; we may make them take the mold of arm or breast, but they mold our hearts, our brains, our tongues to their liking.- Virginia Woolf, Orlando.",2021,Islam Aly,"30.0444, 31.2357",Africa,Global South,https://www.islamaly.com/transpose.html

In Arabic, this system is called Mizan Al Horof; (balance of letters). Statera shows each letter's specific structure, which is built of a significant rule: the number of dots. The 28 letters are printed in Thuluth script with vibrant red color, over regular handwritten text by ordinary people. Different styles, signatures, seals, notes, and markings from legal ledger paper contrast with the Thuluth script rules. This contrast reveals an engaging perspective hidden between the balanced letters and aged documents. The fourteen rhombus pieces of camel bone are engraved with a letter on each side, echoing the book's interior.",2020,Islam Aly,"30.0444, 31.2357",Africa,Global South,https://www.islamaly.com/statera--mizan.html

Issue Press,Reverence: Fundraising print edition for Stop AAPI Hate,"With the alarming rise in hate crimes and xenophobia in the Asian community, I’m reminded of the deep respect we have when we think of our elders who are most impacted by these violent attacks. They’re most vulnerable and made to feel like their pain is not significant. But as most children of immigrants, the reverence we feel for our elders has made the work of dismantling anti-racism even more crucial during this time. This community is built to fight and despite what American history has painted us to become in their eyes, we no longer tolerate that rhetoric. With Lunar New Year just passing, the chrysanthemum is especially symbolic in the Asian community. It signifies vitality and prosperity for all who are gifted it in the new year. Wishing a life of happiness and good health are at the core of how we pay honor to our families. During this time of trauma, we find the joys in our kinship. This is the Asian-American experience. 100% of the proceeds from the Reverence print will go to Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition addressing anti-Asian hate amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

ist publishing,Windmills and Don Quixote. Ukrainian Truth 25,"How the great war that no one believed in began - a reconstruction of the three longest days of February 2022. How Ukraine lost and regained Zmiiniy Island, and the Ukrainian Neptune destroyed the flagship of the Russian fleet - the cruiser Moscow. How a GUR special forces officer sailed for 14 hours in the open sea. How fishermen from Straholissye saved two thousand people from hunger and occupation. How a simple grandmother Polina Rayko from Oleshki became a star of naive art, and Paraska Plytka-Horytsvit from Kryvorivna overcame the Gulag. These are just a few of 30 stories about a country that took on battle with fictional windmills and very real dragons. The book Windmills and Don Quixote. Ukrainian Pravda 25 is a journey that lasts a quarter of a century. Through turbulence, the bitterness of defeats and the warmth of hope. Through revolutions and war. Through ups and downs. From despair and infantile but somehow it will happen and what can I change to the awareness of oneself and one’s own strength.  This journey began with a one-room apartment, which became the first office of the editorial office of Ukrainian Pravda. With five people. Without money. Without guarantees. In a country that got entangled in multi-vectorism and was rapidly sliding towards autocracy. It was then, in the spring of 2000, that Georgy Gongadze chose a hero from a Cervantes novel and a Picasso engraving as the symbol and logo of the Ukrainian Truth. A freak with a spear in his hand, who sees what others turn a blind eye to. This is a story that we have all been writing together for a quarter of a century – every day at a speed of ten news items per hour. The book contains only a few dozen of the hundreds of thousands of texts that have appeared on the site's pages over the years. It is an attempt not to lose the meanings that make us who we are in the flow of time and the kaleidoscope of news. Several dozen names, reconstructions of historical events, portraits of modern Don Quixotes, reports from those places that are now destroyed, left to live on only in our memory and the texts of the authors of the Ukrainian National Opera.  Many names remain in parentheses, but those that managed to fit into several hundred pages hold a common truth that speaks to us all.",2025,,,Europe,Global North,https://istpublishing.org/vitryaki-i-don-kihoti-ukrayinska-pravda-25

Jiazazhi Press,Experimental Relationship,"This book is mainly a collection of photos from Experimental Relationship project from 2007 to 2017. As a woman brought up in China, I used to think I could only love someone who is older and more mature than me, who can be my protector and mentor. Then I met my current boyfriend, Moro. Since he is 5 years younger than me, I felt that whole concept of relationships changed, all the way around. I became the person who has more authority & power. One of my male friends even questioned how I could choose a boyfriend the way a man would choose a girlfriend. And I thought, Damn right! That’s exactly what I’m doing, & why not?! I started seriously thinking about the significance of this relationship, and experimenting with photographs. My photos explore the alternative possibilities of heterosexual relationships. Moro made me realise that heterosexual relationship doesn’t need to be standardised. Depending on the individuals, every two people will have a different type of relationship. Even if the relationship is not the type we are familiar with, it still exists and has its own benefits. The purpose of this experiment is to break the inherent relationship model and reach a new equilibrium. Because Moro is Japanese, and I am Chinese, this project also describes a love-hate relationship. I plan to continue this project as long as we are together. I hope this is the first collection of photos of severals to follow. After taking photos of Experimental Relationship for more than 10 years, I've finally decided to put things into a book. I plan to continue this project as long as Moro and I are together. Hopefully, this is the first collection of photos of severals to follow. — Pixy Liao",2018,Pixy Liao,"29.8683, 121.5440",East Asia,Global South,
Jiazazhi Press,24 Mails from the Railway,"On December 1, 2019, Chinese artist Cheng Xinhao departed his hometown of Kunming to walk along the Yunnan-Vietnam railway all the way to Vietnam. A journey of 465 kilometers that – he reckons in his very first email in the book – would take him between 25 days and a month, depending on his physical condition and possible encounters along the way. In the end, he managed to complete the journey in 19 days. Cheng Xinhao documented his trip in photographs. In each of the photographs, we see him and the railway tracks. These two elements do not change; they are our constant partners on this trip. What changes, though, are the surrounding landscapes, the weather, the time of day, the fauna, the people he meets along the way. For each kilometer of his journey, he picked up a small piece of ballast and added it to his backpack; by the last day, he carries twenty kilograms of the railroad on his back. Each chapter of the book marks another day of walking; we are told the start and finish of each day’s trip, the amount of kilometers walked, and the date. At the end of each day, Cheng Xinhao writes about his journey to X, an imaginary friend. Throughout his letters, we learn about his motivation for the trip, about his intimate connection with this part of the world and its railroad, his hopes, his knowledge of the region’s history, the colonization of the countries in this part of the world, the modernization of South East Asia’s mountainous areas, his childhood memories, his encounters and his observations. The book’s true strengths lie in its meditative nature, the interplay between repetition and change of its images, the solemn, introspective character of Cheng Xinhao’s writings. An ocean! A railway towards an ocean! Can you imagine? Those lights in the dark night would eventually end up in an ocean! And what does this imagery mean to a child living in the mountain area of the hinterland? Since then, my perception of the ocean has been tightly bonded with this railroad. To imagine an ocean through a railroad. This idea still throws me into a kind of self-hypnotic excitement once I think about it. Is this a Kitsch? I have no idea. But this is where I came from and what defines myself. — from Cheng Xinhao’s second mail (2019.11.28)",2020,Cheng Xinhao,"29.8683, 121.5440",East Asia,Global South,https://jiazazhistore.com/products/cheng-xinhao-24-mails-from-the-railway

Until Death Do Us Part focuses on the unexpected role cigarettes play in Chinese weddings. As a token of appreciation, it is customary for the bride to light a cigarette for each and every man invited. The bride and the groom are then invited to play some cigarette-smoking games of an unprecedented ingenuousness. This publication pays homage to a tradition in which love and death walk hand in hand.

"Jordan, jordan Édition",A Kind of Magic,"A Kind of Magic is a photographic journey through a city that no longer exists. Traversing between imagined and experienced realities, the images serve as a portal to a temporal landscape that has been irrevocably altered by external forces. Rooted in Juliana's personal displacement from 1998 Indonesia, a period marked by significant societal unrest and racial tension, the work transforms personal narrative into a resonant exploration of universal themes: displacement, remembrance, and the enduring quest to reclaim our own story. The photographs are accompanied by two essays from Indonesian writer Sylvie Tanaga and artist Metta Setiandi. Similar to Juliana, both authors experienced this period of upheaval during their childhoods.

"Jordan, jordan Édition",The Banda Journal ,"The Banda Journal highlights the legacy of centuries-long colonization and exploitation in the remote Indonesian Banda Islands. An archipelago comprises of twelve small islands surrounded by vast sea, Banda was the setting of some earliest European ventures in Asia and played a key role in global economic history. It is because Banda was once the world’s only source of the highly prized nutmeg, an aromatic spice functioned as preservative and believed as cure for various illnesses in the Middle Ages. The race for the valuable spices sent the Portuguese navigating the Cape of Good Hope, led Christopher Columbus’ discovery of America, and saw the birth of the world’s first multinational trading company: the Dutch East India Company. In Banda, like in many other places, the spice race resulted in the islanders’ misery. And these days, Banda Islands is nothing more than just a backwater. From 2014 to 2017, photographer Muhammad Fadli and writer Fatris MF documented stories from the Banda Islands through a repeated visits and stays.

In its tangible classic form, this non-profit newspaper is distributed free of charge to the public, conveying only, and literally, what the people aspires to. With a thick satirical style, the newspaper asks a simple question to different communities and social groups: “Are you enthusiastic or afraid when you think about the future?”. What the answers reveal is less about what the future holds, but inadvertently highlights the present social challenges that are often glossed over.

In Where Do I Go?, Rania Matar collaborates with women to visually tell their story and their relationship to this beautiful and broken country. She sees her younger self in these women as she herself was 20 when she left Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War. The process is collaborative, and the photo session always evolves organically as the women become active participants in the image-making process, presiding over the environment, and making it their own.

Kaph Books,Two Thousand Years of Non-Urban History,"Two Thousand Years of Non-Urban History revisits the founding principles of architectural and landscape discourse in the Arabian Peninsula. The publication explores instances of pre-oil planning, ranging from desert kites to fish traps and water channels, upending the toolset for thinking through architecture’s relationship to its context. The narrative of the oil economy has overwritten previous traditions of landscape and territory: long spans of highway cut disinterestedly across the desert, vast reclamation works alter the shoreline, and agricultural land is extensively cleared to build new cities. This totalizing mono-myth renders previous spatial narratives as a distant pre-history, more fable than precedent. Two Thousand Years of Non-Urban History acts as a primer to the spatial history of the Arabian Peninsula, compiling narratives related to geology, agriculture, mariculture, and seasonality—providing an alternative genealogy and history from which to reimagine the region. This treatise by Civil Architecture also includes an appendix of the practice’s projects, expanding on the themes of the publication with possible trajectories for architectural intervention.",2025,"Ali Ismail Karimi, Hamed Bukhamseen",,Middle East,Global South,https://www.kaphbooks.com/books/two-thousand-years-non-urban-history/
Kaph Books,Madness of the Anthropocene: Thinking with an image,"This book brings together artists and writers who use image-making and text as means to understand ecological change. By presenting their work here, including ongoing projects and commissioned pieces, the publication conveys knowledge within attentive proximity to the contributor’s own definitions of the subject and their governance of observation and analysis of global crises in the age of the Anthropocene. This experimental approach is inspired by Bayan al-Madrasa al-Kristaliyya (The Crystal Manifesto), published in 1976 by the Crystalist School in Khartoum, Sudan, consisting of Kamala Ibrahim Ishaq, Muhammad Hamid Shaddad, Naiyla al-Tayib, Hisham Abdallah, and Hashim Ibrahim. The editor wanted to utilize this modernist text as a curatorial lens to explore contemporary art, asking primary questions, focusing on recent artistic productions from West Asia and the Gulf region. The manifesto delves into artistic and philosophical commentary on topics such as time, science, space, and language. They also critiqued art-making practices within a growing “universal” imperialist discourse. Their collective thinking, led by Kamala Ibrahim Ishaq (b. 1939, Omdurman), their teacher, resonated with existing African liberation movements of the South as well as Arab and African visual art movements from the 1960s. These movements examined post-independence art making and the challenges of modernist definitions that attempted to flatten identities, events, geographies, and cultures. Madness of the Anthropocene draws inspiration from the “no-color phenomena” within the crystal—an object seemingly colorless whose visibility emerges under pressure—that they highlight. This dual state serves as a metaphorical and literal embodiment, echoing the overarching theme of the book chapters that embrace, in other words, what I call madness as an artistic methodology for image-making today. How do artists articulate or respond to subjects about the Anthropocene? How can we visually rethink disasters and madness, and, what do we do with those resolutions?",2025,Lina Ramadan,,Middle East,Global South,https://www.kaphbooks.com/books/madness-anthropocene-thinking-image/

This volume celebrates movement and travel as creative methodologies, ritual practices and a way of life for Al Saadi, tracing the reciprocal imprint of the artist on the landscape and the landscape on the artist. From his seasonal migrations and treks through the mountains of the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula to excursions as far afield as Brazil, Japan and Antarctica, the book tracks Al Saadi’s peripatetic impulse across a range of overlapping contexts, time-space constellations and bodies of work. Alongside previously unpublished extracts from his sketch books, artist books, daily journals, travel diaries and personal archives, it presents critical and scholarly reflections on his work as well as an interview with the artist and a translated essay about his practice. Positioning Al Saadi as a non-canonical, outsider artist of singular importance, this monograph explores the parallels between his practice and intergenerational rock and boulder art from the Arabian Peninsula. The result of Al Saadi’s unique relationship to Sharjah and longstanding collaboration with the Sharjah Art Foundation, it reflects on the affinities between his artistic approach and intergenerational wisdom as well as land-based practices of the region.",2024,Abdullah Al Saadi,,Middle East,Global South,https://www.kaphbooks.com/books/sometimes-go-long-way-come-back-short-distance/

Kalā Kulo,Your culture is not the Norm,"As an imagined collective, a visceral peculiarity, culture continuously transports individuals between belonging and othering. Flitting between man-made constructs, one might find themselves amidst negotiations of what makes them who they are and whom they are perceived to be. The blending and colliding of cultural hybridity contributes to the disintegration of cultural norms ostensibly tied to caste, geography, accents and creed to name a few.  How we identify, describe and use culture as a definitive tool for comparison is complex. If culture is to be used to account for differences, we might only be able to draw conclusions when a particular feature is an essential attribute and is displayed by all members of a so called ‘group’. Other than viewing culture as a way of life, can it also be perceived as a fluid symbolic exchange between people and their social environment? As a dynamic and very much alive phenomenon undergoing perpetual transformation, the resulting diasporic narrative leads to a somewhat dizzying inquiry. Yet surely, culture facilitates communication, all the while provoking the creation of new meanings, a process moulded by individuals through time and space. The unravelling of the “Nepali” tapestry is not a simple feat; whether seeped in the slanting of eyes, the tall bridge of a nose, elders’ dietary choices, an enforced language, or the oft omitted maternal lineage. Dare we prod at uncomfortable ideas? What are the norms your culture asks of you? Do you comply? A chaotic collision of manifold lenses, this dialogue, is an attempt at doing just this. Disentangling culture, transcending rigid demarcations of what it means to belong, this zine is a collaborative effort, born out of conversations and reflection.",2023,Divya D.

We increasingly search for interpreters for our bombarded present, soothsayers divining untamed futures.  The medium through which information is conveyed, now, as ever, is imbued with these sacred characteristics. It can help you tell right from wrong. It is a stamp of authenticity, or else a libelous scourge. Except if it’s your grandma. Remember, she’s always right. We know that the medium has never been a passive portal. It has always had the power, in itself, to influence the reception of what’s imparted. But today, new mediums emerge and proliferate faster.

Khabar Keslan,Khabar Keslan Magazine Issue 1. Disorient,"Where did you last see your face? Now, especially, the representation of marginalized groups in media is in crisis. Shepard Fairey’s famous portrait of Munira Ahmed, a hijabi woman draped in the American flag, for one, has become a monolithic depiction of an already essentialized people. But not all Muslim or Middle Eastern women wear hijabs, of course. And not all Middle Easterners and North Africans are Muslims or Arabs. We are Coptic, Tuareg, Kurdish, Yazidi, Syriac, Christian, Turkish, Sufi, Maghrebi, Armenian, Zoroastrian, Persian, Aramean, Druze, Berber, Jewish, atheist, and so much more.  Back home, geopolitical shifts circle back to uncertainty. What will become of Yemen? Will the Syrian conflict ever end? How will Iraq be rebuilt? Will Saudi Arabia and Iran finally butt heads? What of Turkish expansionism, or Egyptian and Tunisian political Salafism? Facing unstable futures, dynasties and their opportunists take up space before we have time to organize. The rate of change renders many of us complacent, unwilling to look into the eye of the storm.  To reduce complexity, humans create categories. It’s what we do to make our experiences seem more stable. It’s how our leaders legitimize their ambitions. Yet we know that current labels are profoundly ineffective. Sunni versus Shiite, Islamic versus secular, fries inside versus outside your shawarma... On the ground, these categories naturally start to break down. Our Summer issue, DISORIENT, encourages the expression of regional identities on their own terms. The region isn’t an indistinguishable morass of warring tribes, Islam, oil-rich sheikhs, and sword-wielding militants on horseback—it’s Egyptian working class pop music, Yemeni conflict mediating poets, wry academics, Muslim feminists, and radical artists. Regional art isn’t just geometric patterns—it’s street signs signaling sadness, hijabis draped in the jungle, women without hijabs, Iranian fashionistas, Ottoman icons and Jack Daniels, burnt matches. For Khabar Keslan, to DISORIENT is to actively break categories down—to try our best to capture the infinity of experience in the region. It’s an act of harnessing instability’s power, an acceptance that the quest for understanding is never over. Discomfort and confusion, rather than obstacles, are sources of wisdom. DISORIENT is the antidote to the crisis of representation—when individuals, in all of their incoherence, can represent themselves. DISORIENT is a movement, a long tradition to which this issue pays homage. Current publications such as Ajam Media Collective, Bidoun, Mada Masr, Mashallah News, Muftah, MyKali, Raseef 22, and Reorient: we thank you, for we can only exist because of the work you’ve done.

Khabar Keslan,Khabar Keslan Magazine Issue 2. PASSAGE,"When you’ve moved more times than you can count, uprooted from very different soils, at some point, you’ll get anxious. You’ll stare longingly out a window, down a street, through a doorway. How can you know for certain that the life you’re about to leave behind will keep on? Once you’ve left, does it stop existing altogether? Eventually, when your plane takes off or you pull out of the driveway, that last sliver of home in your periphery is replaced by clouds and wisps whizzing by. You’re about to plant yourself anew—but until you’re in the soil, do you exist? You’re now in-between. Our region is an ongoing migratory network with an ancient history, in which most of us—including many of the editors of this magazine—have participated. Some journeys are more violent than others. Some are voluntary, while others are the results of circumstance. But with every voyage comes a liminal moment wherein the anxiety subsides. While we move, wait, and reflect, an eerie quiet settles in, forcing us to confront our unknowns: a ritual that is, perhaps ironically, familiar and intimate. The contributors to our third issue, PASSAGE, invite us to witness a diverse set of these confrontations. Their work shows us that time and memory defy our expectations, whether we seek to embrace growing older, finally realize our nation’s autonomy, or discover the ghosts of past generations. They point out that new worlds, in the afterlife, in aliens, and in dreams, often resemble our own. They find home at their desks, in proverbs, among small possessions, at dinner parties, or nowhere at all. They highlight the creativity and empowerment that prevail in spite of forced displacement. Through their work, they render seemingly conflicting identities compatible. PASSAGE illuminates the power of the in-between. It makes space for surprises—perhaps even beckoning them. It helps us remain open and welcome the unforeseen.",1000,,"33.8938, 35.5018",Middle East,Global South,https://www.khabarkeslan.com/passage

I’ve always known that my father’s mother, a ‘Bukhari’ Saudi—a term that refers to the city of Bukhara, but encompasses most Central Asian Saudis—came from Uzbekistan. Escaping the Red Army’s Muslim purge, my family found a smuggler, jumped into coffins in the Fergana Valley, and made its way to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Makkah, and finally, Medina. We don’t have photos or belongings from that era. We were allegedly from a farming village called Ekin Tekin, which doesn’t exist anymore—at least not on paper. Similar to my mother’s mother’s Siberian roots, that part of my heritage was always on the periphery, a distant and inaccessible past. In March of this year, I became the first person in my family since the 1920s to visit Uzbekistan—and it was as if my two grandmothers shared the same kitchen. I had pilmeni as an appetizer and manto for the main dish. I had pirashki with my borscht and finished off with a juicy, sumac-sprinkled kibab. I had kasha for breakfast and baklava for dessert. I drank vodka with a mosque printed on the label, the word Allah clearly inscribed on its minarets. I saw Soviet-era apartment complexes towering over a dilapidated fourteenth-century mosque. My memories of St. Petersburg and Jeddah, which had occupied such distant portions of my mind, suddenly knit together as though they had always been of the same place. SOURCE interrogates our overlapping roots, seeking to broaden our notions of the archive. Dynasties come and go, obscuring our access to the past. To ask questions, we often turn to libraries, museums, and monuments—which, unlike people, do not wander. But where can we look to find the wanderers? Which objects tell their stories? The contributors to this fourth issue demonstrate our power to produce our own histories, unmarred by the legacy of empire. They study the composition of their soils: matriarchal face tattoos, listening to Mozart in Syria, cycles. They reclaim our identities from those who have exploited them: our hair, our narratives, and our alienation. And they remind us of a heritage of survival: prison reform and protest justice, skating and fishing, birthdays. Most importantly, they show that, wherever we are and whether or not we know it, we carry our stories with us.",1000,,"33.8938, 35.5018",Middle East,Global South,https://www.khabarkeslan.com/source
Khabar Keslan,Khabar Keslan Magazine Issue 4. Edge,"As a child, I rarely found solace in my difference; mainly solitude. I, like many, am muhajun (مهجن). Masked by the foliage of accents, slang, body language, and adab, I have had to learn how to navigate the environments around me. But at what cost?  In our previous issue, we probed the constitution of identity. To what extent are our subjectivities and relationships formed by the governing structures we exist within? What about the food we eat or the layout of the geography? By focusing on points of overlap, we necessarily investigate parts that don’t; the contours, the limits, the boundaries of any form of distinction, institutionalized or not. EDGE was thus born out of the ambiguous relationship between representation and precarity. Does more visibility make the marginalized more vulnerable? How do we describe the relationship between the periphery and center? Can they exist independently? We began without always knowing the question, but guided by our memories, observations, crossing of boundaries, cultural, emotional, gendered, national, religious.  Khurasan, a cultural and intellectual hub during the Islamic golden age, was divvied up and appropriated by proceeding powers into the complex fringe it is today. Yerevan, which has grappled most recently with visibility, became home to a protest movement engendering Armenian art around the globe. And Fairbanks, the edge of the world, is home to a small community of Kurds from Faraman who escaped persecution—and an unorthodox meeting point for an Iranian academic to reconnect with his childhood. The contributors to this fifth issue reach beyond the center to examine the divided, the contained, and the container. They delve into times of transition, and the risks that follow it. They reveal the hardships that come with the margins, and the strength that accompanies such struggle. They show that we meander through memory and home—fluid experiences engendered by colors, cloth, coins: sensations with which to approach the peripheral perspective. Most importantly, they demonstrate that familiarity with the edge unlocks a power of its own: we are our own centers.",1000,,"33.8938, 35.5018",Middle East,Global South,https://www.khabarkeslan.com/issue-4-edge

Each stroke is a seed: a feminist, popular, and decolonial gesture that opens up new ways of seeing and inhabiting the world. This book is not a passive object, but an insurgent graphic organism. Casimira deploys illustrations as a situated knowledge technology, heir to feminist, popular, and indigenous struggles in Latin America. Her strokes break the framework that normalizes violence, propose other grammars of perception, and transform illustration into an aesthetic and political struggle.

Between drawing and gesture, each page is a thread that transforms absence into presence and transforms the everyday into a constellation. This picture book by Poli Lunar stands as an altar to memory: a trip to Guaytacama and the connection with Grandmother Luzmila, which narrates not a death but the persistence of a presence. Its illustrations inscribe, rather than represent, and transform grief into a sensitive gesture, into a spiral of time where the past and the future coexist. Accompanied by baskets woven in Guaytacama for this edition, Flowers for Your Altar becomes a double body—object and discourse—that sustains the radical tenderness of affection and proposes inhabiting absence as a shared sowing.",2025,Poli Lunar,"-0.2233, -78.5141",Latin America,Global South,https://kikuyoeditorial.com/product/flores-para-tu-altar/

Kong Temporary Archive,Girls in the Park,"What we consider community newspapers encompasses small, limited-edition publications with a community and societal focus. Even those with a personal and handcrafted style are well worth reading. Because these publications are unconventional, they often offer surprising perspectives and insights. Produced and published by Park Flaneuse and supported by MaD Innovation, this zine can be seen as a reminder about the gender disparities in public space use, along with suggestions and designs tailored to women's imaginations and local needs. Using comic strips, the magazine depicts the awkwardness, dilemmas, and stigmatization women face when using local public spaces. The content is straightforward, and the examples used across the pages resonate deeply with many (presumably, Hong Kong women, at least). The French word flâneur means urban flâneur and is a masculine noun. In the past, women seemed unaccustomed to being seen in the city, even wandering freely and aimlessly. Nearly a century later, a female scholar questioned the existence of female slow flâneurs and coined the term flâneuse.

Kong Temporary Archive,Exploration in Southern District Public Housing Estates,"In the Southern District, there are numerous public housing estates built in the 1960s. Generations have lived and grown up in these estates, leaving behind traces of life and wisdom. Over time, these traces continue to ferment and evolve, becoming a living record of community life and development. These small publications, created by students with backgrounds of Social Design, document their visits to Yue Kwong Chuen, Shek Pai Wan Estate, and Wah Fu Estate in Aberdeen. Through on-site observations, the students explored topics which they were interested about, touching on themes such as grassroots design, the use of public and private spaces, and the dynamics of power and balance embedded within the community. When we think about old communities and housing estates, including the relationships between people, people and nature, or people and place, we often view them through the lens of human warmth. It’s as though everything can only be explained by emotions or nostalgia. And when these emotions inevitably fade, all we are left with is regret and reminiscence. However, if we adopt other perspectives—such as architecture, design, anthropology, and urban development—to examine the intangible (and endangered) heritage within, we might uncover the roots of this human warmth. Ideally, we could even develop methods to apply these insights to future community development. The content of these publications briefly summarises the students' observations and analyses during their visits to the housing estates. Although the publications are concise, they highlight the community values and the invisible order behind the angles of concern that each student focuses on.",2025,Social Design Students,"22.3193, 114.1694",East Asia,Global North,
Kult Books,Battered,"Assaults and street fights are everyday activities on weekend nights in Finland. People have a strong tendency to get rather intoxicated when partying and, once drunk, they are released from their inhibitions. Aggression turns into physical acts, to direct violence. There is a social awareness of this topic in Finland. The issue is recognized, and it is considered to be a severe social problem. But the discussion has mainly literal dimensions; it appears in news headlines, and it is discussed in seminars. In the book Battered  the Finnish Photographer Harri Pälviranta shows the real faces of street violence in Finland. In contrast to the stereotypic portrayals of male heroics and the worn-out attempts at shocking people, Pälviranta deals with the utmost banality inherent in violence.  Battered is a project first exhibited in December 2007, and since then pictures from the series have been appeared in tens of exhibitions around the world. At the time of the release of the book 15 pictures from the Battered series were exhibited in the National Museum of Contemporary Art MNAC in Lisbon as part of a bigger solo show by Harri Pälviranta. Even though vastly exhibited, Battered has never been available as a book. This situation is now corrected.",2023,Harri Pälviranta,,Europe,Global North,https://kultbooks.com/books/battered
Kult Books,Filling in the Gaps,"In his debut book Filling in the Gaps, Marcus Gustafsson explores a deeply personal and complex narrative about his father’s alcoholism and its impact on himself and his family. The project reconciles fragmented memories to better understand the circumstances that have shaped his life and relationships, while also serving as an effort toward healing and reconnecting with his fractured family. It confronts the duality of growing up with an alcoholic parent—the struggle to break free while remaining bound by a shared history—and the void left behind when the family’s unifying figure is gone. The work examines how addiction alters family dynamics, leaves lasting marks, and challenges the possibility of moving forward. In Filling in the Gaps, Marcus combines his own images with archival family photographs. His visual language is raw yet stylized, documenting his father’s daily life and surroundings while also turning the camera toward himself, reflecting the tension between reality and memory. Altered family photos—taped or drawn over—become acts of reclamation, as he infuses inherited memories with his own voice. Filling in the Gaps is an emotional exploration of trauma, showing how revisiting painful memories can open paths toward reconciliation and peace with the past.",2025,Marcus Gustafsson,,Europe,Global North,https://kultbooks.com/books/filling-in-the-gaps
Kult Books,LUOGHI,"In his debut monograph, Luoghi, Nicola Buonomo deepens his engagement with nine familiar places. Ranging from his grandmother's backyard to a sand production facility nearby, these are all within a few kilometers of Nicola’s home in Northern Sicily, Italy. The photographs display a subtly dissonant relationship between man-made infrastructure and the natural world. Nicola first defined a clear perimeter for each area, outside of which he could not photograph. In creating these limitations, he ambitiously sought to exhaust most of the possibilities of his gaze within them- prompting a repetitive style of shooting. Sometimes photographing a single subject many times, Nicola forced himself to find new relationships with what he already knew well. In this attempt to enrich his relationship with the familiar, Nicola’s process became synonymous with the final work. Luogo 2 is the vegetable garden located in the backyard of my house. Photographing what I thought I knew was a good opportunity to break down prejudices. The medium, my camera, has helped me in this, giving me back new perspectives on what I have every day in front of my gaze. From this place I was attracted by the many basic geometric elements: the lines, the squares and the X's that are formed mostly by the wooden structures in the garden.",2025,Nicola Buonomo,,Europe,Global North,https://kultbooks.com/books/luoghi
Kult Books,Are we there,"In 1929, Jenni Toivonen’s great-grandparents left everything behind and relocated their family to Brazil. They were part of a group of Finns, led by pastor and gardener Toivo Uuskallio, who hoped to separate themselves from capitalist society and live in harmony with nature. They settled on land surrounded by the Atlantic Forest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, where they founded the community of Penedo. Penedo went on to become one of the most well-known examples of Finnish utopian migration, a movement of similar instances occurring from the late 1800’s to the early 1900’s. Many memories from this time in Jenni’s family are preserved through her grandaunt’s writings, photographs, Brazilian music and stories- which continue to circulate and evolve through generations. Prompted by the nostalgic but vivid world her grandaunt had depicted, Jenni set out to experience it herself. She longed to plunge into the clear mountain rivers and feel a deep, radiant connection with the forest. In revisiting the location her grandparents had inhabited, she strove to experience a shimmer of the utopia Uuskallio spoke of a century ago.  The search for truth and the constant application of what is discovered, through love, is the only reasonable way of being. Through this, knowledge transforms into an experiential understanding of life, which unites people and gives each individual a unique, personalized existence based on free will. In the light of facts, the works of God prove to be the only rightful ones in the economy of nature, while human efforts reveal themselves as erroneous schemes in various forms, opposing the unwavering laws of nature and causing destruction and misfortune. Explore, explore! Experience and live the truth! A letter written by Toivo Uuskallio in 1949.",2025,Jenni Toivonen,,Europe,Global North,https://kultbooks.com/books/are-we-there
Kult Books,Antro,"Delving beneath the surface of everyday life, Andrea Simonato explores a world of underground caves and stone quarries in his second monograph, Antro. Historically prompting a wide array of interpretations -such as sacred boundaries between the human and divine, practical places of refuge or dwellings of the supernatural- caves have attracted countless cultures due to their distinctly ambiguous qualities. Today, these underground structures offer a stark contrast to the precisely defined nature of our above-ground surroundings. The entanglement of corridors and caverns seemingly strip themselves of worldly notions and, in their presence, ask us to do the same. Wandering through a cluster in the hills of South Vicenza, Italy, Andrea delicately approaches both the intricacies and magnitude of these spaces. During the time of the pandemic, I made a habit of climbing the paths leading to the caves and abandoned quarries in the hills near my home. I couldn't say exactly what drove me to go all the way back there each time, perhaps it was just a way of distancing myself from what was happening. There was a calmness and a sense of stability in those places that somehow contrasted the uncertainty and emotional chaos of those months. Entering them and surrendering to their silence and shadows was like stepping into another world and leaving everything else behind, at least for a while.",2025,Andrea Simonato,,Europe,Global North,https://kultbooks.com/books/antro
Kult Books,La Soufrière,"La Soufrière captures a poignant reunion between a father and son after 25 years apart. Swedish photographer Kristian Krän travels to the island of Guadeloupe in the Caribbean to meet his father, Arthur — a meeting that turns out to be both their first and their last. Arthur had left the family when Kristian was just two years old. It was only years later that Kristian learned of his father’s existence and his longstanding mental illness. To meet Arthur and gain understanding, Kristian journeys to Basse-Terre, the capital of Guadeloupe, a quiet town with a shrinking population of around 10,000. Over the course of a week, they explore the island together, visiting places Arthur wants to show Kristian. Communication is difficult, as Kristian’s understanding of Guadeloupean Creole French is limited. Instead, they spend much of their time bonding through music. Kristian’s camera becomes an essential bridge between them, serving as both a means of connection and a source of comfort. One day, they hiked to the top of the volcano La Grande Soufrière. Arthur, dressed in a blazer and flip-flops, kept vanishing and reappearing in the mist. The volcano, a place where some of their most significant memories were made, inspired the book’s title. The word soufrière comes from the French soufre, meaning sulfur or to sulfurize—a kind of sulfurous condemnation. Phonetically, it closely resembles souffrir, the verb meaning to suffer and endure. you are me and I am you we are far from each other but close, forever linked inseparable, yet surrounded by a dense fog that obscures our view we don’t see each other we can’t reach each other and that’s how it will stay An excerpt from a poem by Jowel Rainey and Kristian Krän written for the book.",2025,Kristian Krän,,Europe,Global North,https://kultbooks.com/books/la-soufriere
Kult Books,"Pasaco, 1996","On the 18th of April of 1996, 6-year-old Luis Corzo was abducted together with his father Juan Corzo, Jr. from their home by seven rifle-armed intruders. The kidnapping was organised by a group called Los Pasaco, who were the most feared group of criminals in Guatemala in the early 90s. During the month-long captivity Juan Corzo, Jr. was physically tortured to pressure the family into sending money for ransom. Eventually, Juan was released on the 30th day and told to gather more ransom money in order to have Luis released. Three days later, Luis was released in the small town of Chiquimulilla, Santa Rosa. Pasaco, 1996 is an investigative photography project by Luis Corzo, which contains archival media, as well as new documentation of locations, people, and objects that took part in the act. By making the work Luis wants to initiate conversations surrounding the story; those of violence, corruption, capital punishment, and criminal rehabilitation. … And this is precisely the value of this book you are holding in your hands. It is an accurate record, from the most factual witness: his decision to revisit this chapter of his life is an action that seeks the truth. And truth produces peace and justice.  The interweaving of his story does take the strands of the violence in his country; but most importantly, it is the strength of his steps that takes him forth: his journey to that past is an exercise that seeks reconciliation. An exercise which we, Guatemalans, must observe moved only in the silence of astonishment, the stillness of due regard, and the impetus of imitation.",2023,Luis Corzo,,Europe,Global North,https://kultbooks.com/books/pasaco-1996
Kult Books,Notes For Our Legacy,"Billboards are strategically set up in high traffic areas, designed to catch our attention. They are positioned atop buildings, along highways, and in market squares. Even when devoid of advertisements, they continue to draw one's gaze. The sculpture-like metal frames and blank canvases remind of things that have come and gone. Even in the absence of advertising content, a billboard remains a medium of communication. But when empty of advertisement, what message does it convey? Janne Riikonen's book Notes For Our Legacy serves as a statement against the unsustainable culture of consumption and the values typically conveyed on billboards.   For as long as I can recall, I've been bothered by advertisements—both their appearance and the values they most often promote. I wish I didn't have to see them. The primary message of advertisements is very clear. Whether it's a product, a service, an education, or a political agenda; they aim to sell something. Yet beneath this primary message lies a more subtle, subliminal note of inadequacy – You can do, look and behave better. The work is a manifestation agains these messages, both primary and secondary. The values they promote and with whose terms all of this is done. The constant exposure to advertisements has inevitably contributed to people becoming more materialistic and focused on status. I believe that in a society not as saturated with advertisements, we would be more compassionate and considerate towards one another.

Kult Books,BLUEPRINT 2017-20,"Blueprint 2017–20 explores how the mass media has influenced political debates and democratic processes during the process of Brexit. Norman Behrendt's photographs of Brexit-related video material examine what sort of imagery is used to influence people by stirring up deep-seated attitudes around national pride, immigration and lack of control. The blue color of the cyanotypes reflects the invisible influence of the European Union on the United Kingdom. When Norman Behrendt arrived in London from Berlin in August 2017, he set out to document Britain in the period of its transition out of the EU. He crisscrossed the Remain-voting capital and its Brexit-voting outer suburbs by bicycle, foot and public transport. The photographs that he took revealed material traces of class, race, nationality and income disparity that had fed into the referendum’s result, but they did not get under the skin of the issue in the way that he wanted. Abstract and diffuse, the shift in Britain’s sense of itself eluded a traditional documentary approach. At night, Behrendt surfed the internet, making screengrabs from pro- and anti-Brexit videos on mainstream media, YouTube and social media sites. He immersed himself in official political messaging, amateur propaganda and personal video posts, giving equal attention to both sides of the debate. I am interested in how the mass media contributed to a post-truth political environment. By photographing details of publicly accessible online video content, uploaded on various media channels including newspapers, magazines, Leave and Remain Youtube channels, documentaries and political debates in the UK and EU parliaments, I disassemble the visual layers into their individual parts and thereby scrutinize and recycle these pixelated, transient images.

Kult Books,Orange Street,"In Beijing, the capital of China, thousands of cleaning workers look after the megacity of over 21 million inhabitants. Each of the workers clean the same street seven days a week, twelve hours a day. Although expected to be as inconspicuous as possible, the cleaning workers are an inseparable part of the Beijing cityscape. They are seemingly everywhere and truly indispensable, yet nobody appears to care about their predicament, as if they are tools. With Johannes Frandsen’s direct and close portraits Orange Street presents the people in the working clothes, not only their well known orange outfits. In China, most of the people see 'cleaning worker' as a shameful profession fit only for the inept and talentless – a view that completely disregards how important such work is for the city. Chinese cities have almost no cleaning workers who are younger than 40 years. Most are upper middle aged or older men and women with a rural background, who continue in the line of work for twenty, thirty years. Because of the inadequacy they feel, they instinctively assume an air of humility and self-deprecation in public. Johannes never looks down on these workers.

The featured pages were made between 2012 and 2015 and are for the first time collected as a book. Reading Fearless Colors is like taking a weird acid trip through comics as images fall apart and melt down in front of you, recombining with different images to form brand new comic pages. Samplerman’s collages take existing art and make new art out of the old, and creates comic pages that you just want to get lost in, exploring the smallest details even while wanting to pull out and see how those details collapse into a complete comic experience. - Scott Cederlund, Panel Patter",2017,Samplerman,"56.9677, 24.1056",Europe,Global North,https://www.komikss.lv/books/kus-mono/

Nowadays, in the era of the climate crisis, what is hidden in the depths of the sea exponentially manifests the impact of anthropogenic activity on the planet. Plastic waste and pollution, deep sea mining, and undersea network infrastructures affect marine biodiversity and life on Earth at large. Mediterranean Icebergs sheds light on forms of agency, be it human, more-than-human, or machinic, that operate in marine environments, paying attention to their entanglements, encounters, and asymmetries. Addressing the interconnectedness of environmental, political, and legal issues, this book takes the Mediterranean as a starting point to discuss what is at stake for all lives depending on the planet’s seas and oceans.",2025,,"37.9838, 23.7275",Europe,Global North,https://kyklada.press/product/mediterranean-icebergs/?v=75778bf8fde7

Today, a disproportionate number of persons with physical impairments and debilitating conditions remain largely invisible. The writing in this book points to different experiences of movement, time, and space: Whether through the creation of a vernacular sign language; a different pacing of time and projection of futurity; exchanging forms of care around a healing spring; recording the ways in which 3 generations navigate everyday interactions through a ‘broken telephone line’ of connection; or the friendship between a woman with visual impairment and her dog, Mercy, who helps her navigate the narrow busy sidewalks of central Athens.

Today, at the edges of democracy, and as obedience increasingly becomes an imperative for public presence, the specter of exile islands resurfaces. The entry point for this book is a research trip to Gyaros, an island scarred by memories of displacement and persecution — memories today at risk of erasure and privatization. Islands of Exile weaves together stories of exiled mothers, dogs, dissidents, and psychiatric patients in the Aegean Sea, narrating how humans can carve out spaces of hope and persistence.",2025,,"37.9838, 23.7275",Europe,Global North,https://kyklada.press/product/islands-of-exile/?v=75778bf8fde7
kyklàda.press,Islands After Tourism,"Tourism does more than transforming spaces and forcing emotions: its geographies also conceal a persisting power that captures the imagination. In their operational sturdiness, tourismscapes appear intractable and inert, making their alternative renderings almost unthinkable. It feels uncanny to picture islands and their coasts freed from programs of leisure. But in recent years, the exhaustion of people and landscapes has brought forth a renewed imperative to think outside this ubiquitous extractive industry. Through essays, pieces of fiction, and visual references, this book discusses both the difficulty and the necessity of disrupting the monocultural imaginations of tourism. To escape the devouring vortex of its sticky nature and messianic promises, the cultural and political work necessary is not only this of negation and resistance, but also that of bold re-conceptualizations and re-imaginings.",2023,,"37.9838, 23.7275",Europe,Global North,https://kyklada.press/product/islands-after-tourism/?v=75778bf8fde7

After all, amidst ongoing processes of extinction, how to mourn a queer activist, a Roma father, a burnt forest, an exiled body, and a ship sunken in the Mediterranean? How to experience loss not as something individual, but within an expanded continuum of pain? How to explore emotions beyond the private sphere?

But behind the leisurely scattered bodies and the quiescent summer shores, beachfronts are assembled as intensely ordered infrastructures for the heavy machineries of tourism. Approaching the beach as an operational socio-technical landscape, this book unpacks stories of construction, programming, and maintenance: from traces of moving sands in Lefkada island to mirror postwar developments in Delos and Mykonos islands, and from historic and bodily excursions to workings of the Athenian riviera to rituals of eco-certification under Blue Flags. The texts frame the beach as a machine, one with protocols of function and metabolic needs, studying how it directs the capture of land and bodies, while establishing forms of environmental control.",2022,,"37.9838, 23.7275",Europe,Global North,https://kyklada.press/product/the-beach-machine/?v=75778bf8fde7

Whose lungs and souls are capitalized upon and hidden under the suffocating dust in mining shafts? To whom do the surface of the land and its underground belong? This book takes proto-industrial mining in the Aegean island of Serifos as an entry point for disclosing historical and contemporary consequences of politics of the soil through land extraction, and looks at how mineral evidence was historically produced, disseminated, and capitalized upon in the Aegean region and beyond.",2022,,"37.9838, 23.7275",Europe,Global North,https://kyklada.press/product/bodies-of-extraction/?v=75778bf8fde7

What happens when an architect steps into this process of anonymous transmission of skills?

Limestone Books,Amsterdam Lunch,"This small book is a report on a re-enactment project by Taiwanese designer Chen Jhen, recalling her attempts to assimilate into Dutch culture at the lunch table of an Amsterdam design agency. Desperate, she secretly jots down very precise notes on the – for her unfathomable – way the other people around the table are eating and behaving. These notes then form the script for a performance of this observed ‘lunch table behaviour’. The book is a written-out version of the performance: her reworked notes, descriptions of actions spread across the pages (‘chewing – chewing – scooping some salad with fork’) and photos of gestures and plates of food. Using a visible screen works like a translation of the process of zooming in on the details observed. Chen dissects table manners like an anthropologist, resulting in a surprising, at times rather embarrassing but also hilarious reflection on Dutch ‘lunch table culture’. As we have seen several times this year, creative use is made of transparent paper: for example in the title and subtitle, printed in sections on the next and even the following page – so ‘being the other’ is literally consigned to another page.

Limestone Books,"Perverted Norm, Normal Pervert","In the project, Perverted Norm, Normal Pervert, artist Kuang-Yi Ku collaborates with scientist Dr. Joris M. Koene, associate professorin the Amsterdam Institute for Life and Environment at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The scientist’s research demonstrates the gender fluidity of a non-human species, which is the starting point of this project at some level. Koene’s expertise lies in the hermaphroditic reproduction strategies of snails, and he has a well-equipped breeding facility for freshwater snails. Using this system, Koene’s research has revealed various aspects of snail reproduction. From his research, we find that part of the nature in snail’s sexual activities, which are taken for granted, may seem abnormal in human society. However, some sexual activities of snails are becoming normal in the context of human society. That is to say, in this case, the definition and boundary of normal and pervert are fluctuating and unstable. Such fluidity reflects the affinities and differences among different species; in the meantime, such fluidity prompts us to rethink the rigidity of human society’s perception of sex. In this project, Ku first focuses on four particularities of sex to compare and contrast the sexual activities between snails and humans, taking scientific knowledge as the basis, for the following visual art creations.",2023,,"50.8514, 5.6910",Europe,Global North,https://limestonebooks.org/products/perverted-norm-normal-pervert?_pos=6&_fid=44477b71d&_ss=c

Limestone Books,Cut from a Bigger Cloth,"Cut from a Bigger Cloth reflects the path that brought Addoley Dzegede to making textile work based primarily on the history of wax print and how Dutch manufacturers copied Indonesian batik through an industrial process, making a cloth that eventually became so identified with Africa that many don't realize its origins. The book is divided into sections, including photos from Addoley's family archive of studio photographs in the years following Ghana's independence from British colonization, and one photo possibly from before (of Addoley's great-great-grandfather). Some of the wax prints that family members and her father’s friends are wearing are still made today by Vlisco in Helmond. There is a section of risographs based on drawings she made of batiks in the Quai Branly collection and at the Victoria & Albert Museum. And there are her musings on how she became interested in these histories, trains of thought made during research trips, examples of her work over the past 7 years, as well as a section with natural dye recipes from the Color + Conquest course she taught at Piet Zwart Institute.",2023,Addoley Dzegede,"50.8514, 5.6910",Europe,Global North,https://limestonebooks.org/products/cut-from-a-bigger-cloth?_pos=8&_fid=44477b71d&_ss=c

The zoo is a place of nostalgia and wonder, and reflects our preconceived ideas about nature, but what do stories of sexuality from the perspective of the zoo's residents tell us about our own sexuality? Is there such a thing as sexual freedom for the caged To what extent is a 'forced marriage' allowed, and how do you decide for insemination? For this publication, Kuang-Yi Ku and Thijs de Zeeuw started by researching the role of sex and reproduction in the zoo. But, as it is with sex, they couldn't stop fantasizing, and so this publication is not just a presentation of their research, but contains speculative designs as well.

Sometimes, someone else's pain, anger, or sadness can seem as if it were your own. We blend together like emulsified oil and water. But you are only you, and I am only me.

This book is a collection of hand-drawn illustrations depicting TV monsters—creatures brought to life by actors in costumes. Each piece was drawn by hand, scanned, and carefully prepared for risograph printing, embracing the raw, textured charm of the medium.   But beyond the vibrant colors and bold lines lies a deeper reflection: What if the monster haunting you is just a person playing a role? And what if, when you finally tear off the mask… you find yourself staring back?   Monstruos explores the duality of villainy—both on screen and within ourselves. It’s a visual meditation on how we unknowingly become the architects of our own struggles, blurring the line between performer and monster. Imagine catching your tormentor, ripping off their mask… and discovering it’s you.

Karam’s practice moves fluidly between photography, printmaking, and installation, always returning to walls as sites of dialogue—between people, architecture, and time.

Makan Press,A-Ma,"At its heart, A-Ma is a portrait of Ethan Lan’s grandmother, created in the aftermath of his grandfather’s passing after sixty years of marriage. Through tender photographs of daily rituals and ordinary objects, Lan explores grief as it lingers in the details of domestic life. What begins as a family archive unfolds into a meditation on memory, resilience, and enduring love. At once deeply personal and universally resonant, A-Ma is both a family archive and a meditation on resilience. Guided by a language of closeness, Lan’s photographs move beyond documentation. They become acts of listening—glimpses into the unspoken bonds between generations, the fragility of memory, and the enduring traces of love. With A-Ma, Ethan Lan’s debut artist book, both the story and craft are celebrated – where the book itself becomes part of the story.

Makan Press,Taipei,"A solo long-form project by Yemeni American artist Ibi Ibrahim.

The act of archiving memories away from home is fueled by the photographer’s relationship to his own homeland, Sana’a, where a once familiar taste of freedom can no longer be captured due to ongoing war and conflict. Ibi Ibrahim (b. 1987, Michigan, United States) is a Yemeni-American visual artist, musician and photo book publisher. He studied photography at the International Center of Photography in New York. Ibrahim’s work explores various thematics surrounding immigration, gender and resilience. All marked by notions of in-betweenness, transition and the diasporic human experience.

Max Pinckers,Colour Theory,"What if National Geographic photographers occasionally brought red clothing with them on assignment to put on their subjects, in order to make ‘better pictures’ on Kodachrome film? When Kodachrome was introduced in 1936, National Geographic photographers were among the first to embrace the new colour film, which was admired for its exceptionally vibrant red. This eventually led to an exaggerated worship of colour that culminated in what became known as ‘The Red Shirt School of Photography’: a rumour that photographers deliberately dressed people in red clothing to create stronger compositions, especially within the tradition of landscape photography. People wearing red are often seen looking out over a vast landscape from a mountaintop ridge or balcony, a pose described as the ‘monarch-of-all-I-survey’. Time and again, the magazine featured white explorers, scientists, photographers and travellers perched out over distant landscapes, implying dominance and ownership over the land. The observer glorifies it as something beautiful, rich in resources and therefore ‘worth taking’. Translating this colour theory into four-colour risograph printing emphasises the layering and blending of different colours in an attempt to attain that cherished Kodachrome red. In a speculative guessing game about the extent to which photographers manipulated their scenes, Colour Theory brings together a selection of images from National Geographic magazines from 1936 to 2009—the lifespan of Kodachrome film—in which people could, perhaps, have been directed to wear red.",2025,"Max Pinckers, Victoria Gonzalez-Figueras",,Europe,Global North,https://www.maxpinckers.be/archive/colour-theory/
Max Pinckers,"State of Emergency - Mau Mau Movement for Justice, Equality and Our Land","State of Emergency - Harakati za Mau Mau kwa Haki, Usawa na Ardhi Yetu (Mau Mau Movement for Justice, Equality and Our Land) is the result of a ten-year collaboration with Mau Mau freedom fighters and Kenyans who survived colonial atrocities. In the form of in-person reenactments, or 'demonstrations', together they (re) visualize the fight for independence from British colonial rule in the 1950s, manifesting their past experiences in the present with a future audience in mind. With most of the colonial archives deliberately destroyed, hidden or manipulated, this project attempts to shine a light on this history’s blind spots by creating new ‘imagined records’ that fill in the missing gaps of historical archives. State of Emergency interweaves fragmentary colonial archives, photographs of architectural and symbolic remnants from the past, mass grave sites, demonstrations and the testimonies of people who experienced and survived the war themselves. State of Emergency has led to the creation of an ecological initiative managed by the Mau Mau War Veterans Association, which aims to restore and rehabilitate ancestral forest land that has been exhausted by colonialists cutting down hardwood forests and planting exotic water-draining trees such as eucalyptus, cypress and pine. These forests were instrumental for the Mau Mau freedom fighters in their resistance to colonial violence land urgently needs to be replenished with indigenous vegetation to fight the disastrous effects of climate change. The long-term goal of State of Emergency is to provide access to larger institutional support, funding possibilities and partner organizations to create a sustainable future for the veteran communities and their children.",2024,Max Pinckers,,Europe,Global North,https://www.maxpinckers.be/books/state-of-emergency/
Max Pinckers,The future without you,"For this collaboration, Max Pinckers and Thomas Sauvin rummaged through 50.000 transparencies rescued from a recycling center in Beijing. This analog archive from the 1990s consists of stock photos produced in the US which ended up in China when a company subsidiary was opened to market them in a new territory. The images in this archive cover a wide array of subjects, themes, and photographic styles. They were made with the sole intention of being purchased or licensed for nonspecific contexts. They represent an era of advertising when high-quality, generic visuals would be adopted by companies to avoid the expense and effort of arranging custom photoshoots. As stock photography embodies the most expressly capitalist form of imagery, Pinckers and Sauvin focused their selection on the world of corporate business represented by actors of limited talent, during a time of anxiety triggered by the arrival of the personal computer and the rise of the Internet. Revisited 30 years later, there is something amusing—but also disturbing, even prophetic—about these images, which seem to have lost none of their relevance with the advance of artificial intelligence.",2023,"Max Pinckers, Thomas Sauvin",,Europe,Global North,https://www.maxpinckers.be/books/the-future-without-you/
Max Pinckers,Lotus,"In the series Lotus, the gender crisis that kathoey face is transformed into a visual metaphor about the identity crisis that contemporary documentary photography encounters. Pinckers and De Bruyn believe that photojournalists and documentary photographers generally reproduce common aesthetic approaches that are not adapted to the subject matter and are often driven by tropes and clichés to produce the desired effect. In this series they have tried to comment on this approach by making explicitly manipulative, aesthetic images, but also by distributing disposable cameras to the people they have followed in order for them to contribute their own photographs to the series. The photographs in Lotus feel staged yet appear too spontaneous to be directed. Pinckers and De Bruyn treat locations like a stage onto which potential situations unfold. A photographic environment is created by way of a decisive frame illuminated by intricate artificial lighting. Technical production elements explicitly reveal this theatrical construction by sometimes showing tripods or lighting equipment within the frame. Images often include the figure of the meta-spectator (someone that looks at the main characters within the same photograph) or the meta-photographer (a photographer within the image photographing the same scene), all within a visual space of spontaneous theatricality.",2011,Max Pinckers,,Europe,Global North,https://www.maxpinckers.be/projects/lotus/
Metatron Press,The Snakes Came Back,"In its palm, time is a gap that is closing, But the spirit throws its head to the wind without hurry. It has looked out at time’s expanse. It already knows it’s infinite. In Lora Mathis’s poems, the body is a temporary resting place for the infinite, resilient soul. The Snakes Came Back follows a speaker contending with trauma in the slipstream of earthly time. Mathis’s poems are peopled with friends and lovers—both named and anonymous, current and past—and invested in necessary interdependence as a means of healing the self. But the self is not fractured. The self is composed of memory, navigating impulses of woundedness with awareness and compassion. Mouths and tongues figure prominently throughout this reflective and forthcoming collection, evocative of the insatiable desire of our hungry ghosts. The mouth is, however, as much a space of hunger and desire as it is an erogenous zone of self-expression and agency. Mapping affective geographies of memory, The Snakes Came Back cracks open everyday tasks and familiar landscapes to reveal their haunting depths. Saturated with heat and wind, Mathis’s poems vibrate with the will to face life’s temporality, its impossible contradictions, its beauty and its pain: “There is loss, but there is renewal too.”",2023,Lora Mathis,,North America,Global North,https://metatron.press/shop/the-snakes-came-back/
Metatron Press,The Choice Is Real,"Jayson Keery’s world-building poems reimagine the coming-of-age narrative for queer and trans people. Winner of The Metatron Prize for Rising Authors (Poetry), The Choice is Real is a romp through millennial media landscapes and an interrogation of their power as systems of early childhood gender programming. Challenging the conventions of how queer and trans people are encouraged to tell their stories, The Choice is Real engages the concept of choice in queerness and trivializes the linear “born-this-way” narratives that queer people are sold. In response to a second puberty brought on by medical transition and an unravelling of family structures following the death of their stepmother, Keery regresses through a warped and foreboding childhood landscape saturated with pop culture iconography. Writing with and against Disney classics, Keery moves between formative memories and contemporary moments, weaving in accounts of current relations in their playful uprooting of assumptions of queer relationality. Opening with a cheeky epigraph from trans author and activist Lou Sullivan: “I love being a girl. So delicate,” The Choice is Real explodes with celebration and criticism of girlhood from a transmasculine perspective.",2023,Jayson Keery,,North America,Global North,https://metatron.press/shop/the-choice-is-real/

Faced with the difficulties of her life, scrolling through photos of an uber-celebrity and talking to her cat is the only way Frankie knows how to cope—through fantasy and escape. Exploring politics—personal, political, social—to comment on feminism, the #MeToo movement, fame, abuse of power within university writing programs, intergenerational wealth, love, and our multiple selves, there is something lovable about Frankie’s insufferable attitude towards life; something deeply relatable about her self-doubt in convincing herself she’s “never going to make anything of my goddamn, pathetic life.” Why? Because Frankie is stuck in a capitalist cycle of celebrity marketing rings that target young women’s insecurities about their bodies and accomplishments.

Bára Hladík’s New Infinity is a glittering cross-genre debut. Weaving surrealist stories with meditative poetics, Hladík invites you into a dream world of degenerative illness, left disordered by the failures of ableism, medical professionals, and late-stage capitalism. Here, everything runs on sick time.

Even something that helps carry us and offers us support—a saddle, for instance—can be uncomfortable, painful even, excruciating.

In decentering expected narratives surrounding identity, This book creates a new world for us to consider in the process. Exploring how phenomena with extremely complex geopolitical histories are abstracted and reduced to flattened articulations of identity and relationality, Viola Chen questions: to what ends and for the benefit of whom? Chen attempts an alternative method through hardship, refusing to pay its constellations of intimacy due respect, and instead embodies a language of resistance that spreads like fire across the page.",2020,Viola Chen,,North America,Global North,https://metatron.press/shop/no-problematics/

Desire, affect, anger, and healing collide in Baranova’s metaphysical observations of her lived experiences. Whether through the lens of philosophy or astrology, algorithms or nausea under capitalist hegemony, CONFIRMATION BIAS considers the obstacles of being, relating, and rebuilding in the face of sociocultural fragmentation and imminent global collapse.

Metatron Press,Our Lady of Perpetual Realness & Other Stories,"Band sucked. I didn’t want to be a professional flutist anyway. The other kids in the orchestra didn’t even drink. I wanted to be more like Sid. In grade 10, Sid got sent to the office for being drunk in second-period science. He told the vice principal to go fuck herself and then he puked all over her desk. Sid rarely came to class, but he was always roaming the halls with this big rainbow Louis Vuitton handbag dangling from his arm. Beth said it was probably a knock-off. Two teenagers shoot amateur porn. Coworkers pool hop after dark. A call centre employee scrambles to keep their shitty job. Sweetheart tries something new in order to pay rent. A group of friends get stoned and go to the movies. Did you hear about the drag BBQ on Saturday? Everyone’s going to be there, and everyone’s going to bring an amazing look. Set in the twin backdrops of Toronto and Montreal, Our Lady of Perpetual Realness is a glimpse into the lives of contemporary queer youth. Equal parts wry and tender, these six stories follow young, gay men of colour through the confusing, bleak, and often humorous aspects of their day-to-day lives as they struggle to discover the world and their place within it.",2017,Cason Sharpe,,North America,Global North,https://metatron.press/shop/our-lady-of-perpetual-realness-other-stories/

The images were made over four years (2018–2021), during which she observed and photographed her city through a lens of grief and emotional turbulence. Delhi, the capital of India, has been the seat of power for many empires. It is chaotic, aggressive, eerie, and ugly, but also charming, resilient, surreal, and seductive. Perhaps it is all these things because of what it has survived: being built, razed, and rebuilt, century after century. They say the city has been rebuilt seven times, with the one standing today being the eighth—a crowded, noisy concrete labyrinth, a sedimented necropolis. Among dusty tombs of forgotten royalty, bolted staircases, and bored pigeons; amidst seasonal flowers, frustrated graffiti, and neglected museum treasures, Kira shows her city—as a djinn.",2024,Kira Issar,"-37.7596, 145.0005",Oceania,Global North,https://loveyoumom.net/as-a-djinn-1
MOM,Love,"Through an unflinching lens, we witness her most intimate moments in relationships with men , women, friends and strangers. Using photography, she explores her own perversity, laid bare in all its complexity. This is not a sanitized or romanticized portrayal, but a visceral and unvarnished exploration of the reality of her experience. With a likeness to that of artists who revel in obscenity such as Bruce LaBruce, Nan Goldin, Ran Hang & Peter Berlin, Bliss’s 35mm film photography, handwritten diary entries and personal contents are laid out and exposed into a page-turning piece. The graphic imagery of nudity and blood are not used for shock value, but as a testament to the rawness and vulnerable nature of human intimacy. This is contrasted with softer moments from Bliss’s life, moments of humor, romance and melancholy. ‘Love’ is a declaration of autonomy, a rejection of societal expectations, and a celebration of the unapologetic self. Making the viewer question their own hesitance to the imagery, which is met with a desire to find the beauty in what some see as shocking and extreme.",2024,R.BLISS,"-37.7596, 145.0005",Oceania,Global North,https://loveyoumom.net/LOVE-1
MOM,Real Crooks Are Never In Prison,"Real Crooks Are Never In Prison presents an Australian road trip like no other. The publication display’s Lawrence’s point of view in regard to the still present visual identity of colonialism, monarchism and nationalism on the Australian flag. A flag that has traumatic colonial representation and is still displayed despite this. Growing up in a colonial town, denial is forever present in our Australian identity. I grew up without knowing what this flag represented. In 2021 I left Mparntwe (Alice Springs) to embark on an Australian road trip. That country, and the local mob left a life-long impression on me. The struggle for justice, truth telling, repatriation and community control were thoughts I constantly had while driving these long stretches of highways. Every town I passed had monuments, pubs, trucks, cars, servo’s, businesses, houses and even horses where the Australian flag was flown. Not the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Flag. We travelled north then south, east then west. Across Australia with some of my best mates. Every town we went too there were flags everywhere. I wanted to make a statement and a body of work that could be understood by all. Regardless of wealth, status or class. A simple and classless idea that should be shared like the fuel between friends on a long drive and spark a much larger conversation. I set out to make something as disorganised and messy as our trip was, that would crease, be drawn on and then fall apart. And for those who have it to treat it like I did, to throw it in the back of your car and leave it on the corner of the road when your done. Maybe someone, somewhere will pick it up and think about what needs to change no matter how tarnished it may be. The book was originally made from divider folders found at a tip. The images were scanned along the road at various stops. Printed in various shops, stuck in taken out then re stuck in all over the country. A little barely readable map shows the way. The images in this book create a simple and abrupt visual message that can relate to many people around Australia and the world. It is in many ways a comment on the weight the flag bears for so many, and seeks to question whether this flag upholds the values that many Australians hold.",2024,Lawrence McCrabb,"-37.7596, 145.0005",Oceania,Global North,https://loveyoumom.net/Real-Crooks-Are-Never-In-Prison
MOM,Marissa,"Joey’s debut publication; Marissa, reflects an America lost in translation but newly discovered through his unique view of this foreign land. Your idols are magical and important. Where in this case meeting the culture, landscape, people and places you have idolised may just as easily change or discount your view of them. The American landscape was something I only ever saw in films. As a film maker travelling there was something I needed to do. I wanted to explore the backdrops of what had inspired me most. When there I was confronted by the baron and run down landscape, the natural order of the U.S. was not what I had imagined. Yet, I was drawn to the beauty and the characters that occupied it. Zig zagging up and down throughout each state in my $500 van (Marissa), I captured a world I had only seen visually before with a new understanding of how it could look. To Idolise is to have prejudice that can hinder a clear thought. Engrained within society and media, America acts as a big brother to our Australian culture. The films we grew up watching control the very essence of magic that we believe the American dream has. A dream, for most Australian youth. Sought after by moving overseas to make it. Joey’s body of work demystifies the ideas based around the American dream. His individual discovery of a culture and landscape act as a catalyst to Joey’s changing idea of the states through this narrative. Marissa plays as a vehicle of transposition, while slowly debunking the truth about how a culture that has so heavily influenced the outside world could look to a foreign eye. Existing in the beautiful space between contrast and commonality, the book acts as a beautiful yet grim environment for Joey’s visual exploration.",2023,Joey Knox,"-37.7596, 145.0005",Oceania,Global North,https://loveyoumom.net/Marissa
MOM,Divine State,"Set in the Caucasus mountains, Divine State is a series of photographs that examine our complex relationship with mortality. For humans who cannot bear to follow natural order, the social-cultural ‘hero’ narratives of legacy, religious piety and memorial promise different forms of eternity. Establishing denial towards death becomes critical to well-being in a functioning society. Symbolically, to defy death is to live forever, in a divine, god-like state. Though, in a cyclical inevitability, things begin to crumble, wrinkle and decay around us and the most terrifying admission – one the philosopher William James describes as the worm-at-the-core – sets in. Photographed at the end of 2021 using medium format film, Swinburn mixes intimate human moments with reminders of the past, austere landscapes and imposing mountains to address the complexities of this profound dilemma. What emerges is either a quiet desperation or a liberating truth. This is Thomas’s debut publication.",2022,Thomas Swinburn,"-37.7596, 145.0005",Oceania,Global North,https://loveyoumom.net/Divine-State-1

Through these both abstract and literal works, Jim creates imagined narratives around these events that showcase the deceased in the moments leading to their end. It makes for a compelling and unique outlook on both life and death. The painting’s Jim McCullough has created for this book, Glue Factory, are both one large self portrait in its own right, but also split off individually, showing a time in Jim’s life that not many people would ever be able to go through.

MOM,Creep,"Street photography is rooted in its ability to see the surreal, satirical and beautiful in what we are surrounded by daily. This can be a difficult task when in new and unfamiliar environments. How can one identify these qualities in places where everything is surreal and interesting to new eyes? Jake's images not only display such themes but blend them between cultures, nationalities and environments. He views the world through a beautiful and sometimes disturbing lens that blends humanity, grace and pain. Creep is like a strange dream that wakes you up in the middle of the night. Examining one's own existence by reflecting on the humans that inhabit this world. Jake's observations expose the considerable norm that we thought we were familiar with. Across countries, landscapes, cities, pubs and carnivals Jake inspects the abnormality and beauty one finds in darkness. These intrusive yet collaborative images between subject and observer, stop us in our tracks and force us to reflect on these people's lives as they are too caught up in this fantasy to do so themselves. Creep is a diptych photo book shot on B&W 35mm film across Australia, Indonesia, Sri lanka and The USA.",2021,Jake Vincent,"-37.7596, 145.0005",Oceania,Global North,https://loveyoumom.net/Creep-1
MOM,Wreckage,"This book is a result of a physical journey Lawrence undertook back home, to an area he once ravaged through in his younger years. It is an attempt to demonstrate the destruction he encountered as a boy, and his loss of connection to the area as he grows away from his past, leaving moments behind that stagnate in an environment that has been laid to waste. An encountering of memories and the way they reside within you. Cluttered, unorganised and messy. Wreckage is in many ways my strange attempt at an autobiographical narrative. Paralleling light, violence and form in order to reconstruct the memories of my younger psyche as I came to terms with the world that was constructed around me. Reconnecting with the environment that saw the destructive behaviour of my wayward youth, which I often think was inspired by curiosity and not malice. Forms and silhouettes of rubble caught my attention, but it wasn’t until I used a flash to bring light to the darkness that I discovered what I was seeing for a split second, only for it to disappear a moment later. The idea of a distant memory being brought into the light was present for me. The memory of once growing up in an area that is now forgotten and isolated, detached and dark. My desire to possess these memories has culminated into this physical object. A photo book. Fragments of the junkyard act as stimulating motion and action to the psyche of a juvenile, emulating the detachment and loneliness many encounter as they grow. The photos reflect a natural impulse for watching things be destroyed and document the way in which one encounters and reacts to the polluted world left by others. This photo book is a manifestation of Lawrence’s attempt to understand where things fit together by first breaking them apart.",2021,Lawrence McCrabb,"-37.7596, 145.0005",Oceania,Global North,https://loveyoumom.net/WRECKAGE-1
MOM,An Exploration of a Printed Pages Value,"An Exploration of a Printed Page’s Value is a research project trialing the theory of negative space value within books. It surveys the treatment of a page’s space as property through the role of advertisement in an unorthodox analogue setting. The book acts as a commercial product in its own right. The more commercially cluttered the pages progressively become, the more interruption that occurs to the freedom and availability for design, as the available space is sold to mass consumption. Growing up I was groomed into a design path essentially. Both parents established designers in their respected fields. In saying this however, one parent is in advertising. To the disappointment of that parent, I repent the notion of commercial design and the idea of following the ‘money’ instead of holding artistic integrity. The publication isolates adverts found across sourced material and ratio replicated within the page size to highlight the interruption of space caused in the confines of their original sources. The negative space gradually becomes suffocated as you progress through the book, taking away availability for design to exist.",2021,Millie Corbett,"-37.7596, 145.0005",Oceania,Global North,https://loveyoumom.net/EXPLORATION-INTO-PRINTED-PAGES-VALUE
MOM,Carnival ,"Carnival is a photo book by Melbourne based photographer and film maker, Oscar O’Shea. The book is a result of a photo project Oscar took on at the end of 2019. He attended the Melbourne Cup Horse Races in efforts to create an exposé photo series on the people that attend the event as well as the environment it takes place in. Driven from a hatred of the shocking levels of animal cruelty and material excess that is associated with the event and carried out during it. I was very curious about what an event like this even looks like, especially through the lens. It was and still is, quite shocking, the whole experience didn’t feel real, a majority of the people who attend this event are from a place of privilege and showcase that very heavily. I find it sad and yet interesting that the people who are ablest to acquire a quality education and upbringing are able to become adults that lack such compassion and can live such a self important life. Putting meaningless drinking, parading and betting before the wellbeing of animals and the environment. This is white privilege at its worst. - Oscar O’Shea The project has formulated into a comprehensive and intimate portrayal of the event and the people who attend it. The book is called Carnival and comprises of 96 pages of colour photographs that capture attendees of the event in an honest and un filtered way.

Living with a lifelong mental illness like bipolar can at times feel incapacitating in a way difficult to tangibly describe, and can make it painfully difficult to understand identity as a unified whole. How do you show someone what depressive episodes spanning 10 years looks like, with full shapes? And then how do you convince people to care? The collaborative images are illustrated by Madeline, Rosemary’s best friend and roommate. In each image both sides are needed to give context to the whole. Through many iterations of the drawings, Madeline grasped at the ineffable qualities and quantities of feeling that inhabit Rosemary’s world. But failing that, all she could do was explore perspective- get in close and back all the way up to try and see each wholeness of the thing. Paired with the non-dual images moving the reader in and out of orbit with the world, Rosemary reveals parts of their ongoing journey of recovery with a gravitational push for more equity for marginalized mentally ill folks.

Moniker Press,Nunca há Nada | There Is Never Nothing,"Nunca há Nada | There Is Never Nothingis a collection of poems that look into the performativity of the poetic language as potential to expand Luciana Freire D’Anunciação’s performance art and dance practice. They are based on the improvisation technique of paying attention to the smallest events from the continuous stimuli exchange between the internal and external worlds in the present moment. Poetry here becomes a medium for creatively documenting performances she did or witnessed — and after the fact chose to frame it as such. Most of the texts were written during the second year of the pandemic. Some of them she wrote first in English, some in Portuguese, some in Canada and some in Brazil. Later she translated them embracing the oddness of translation gaps and the impossible literal translations. This also reflects her condition as a Brazilian immigrant living in Canada, who reconciles two languages, two cultures, and two art disciplines (poetry and performance) as well as pursues never-ending questions around identity and sense of belonging.

Moniker Press,Passage and Portal,"The actions we must take to slow a pandemic can become concentrated anxiety, gripping the collective guts a little tighter every day. A tangled knot; embodied uncertainty, and a portal; a looking glass; the possible futures that exist on the other side. Tubes lead into the feeling of time, expanding to step through a portal, and stretching over a threshold very slowly and very carefully. Passage and Portal is a mixture of collage, drawing and painting melded together with the risograph medium. A glimpse into the perspective of Sunny Nestler who lives with an immune disease that affects their digestive system, throttling their upper cerebral-brain and lower gut-brain into overdrive.

Multipress,diafragma,"diafragma is photo book by Signe Fuglesteg Luksengard composed of folded sheets in varying sizes, all housed within a custom-made box. In this work, Luksengard delves into how stress and societal expectations imprint themselves on the body and mind. Through layered and tactile imagery, she reflects on the unseen rhythms and pressures that shape our lives. The title diafragma—referring to the diaphragm muscle—serves as a metaphor for the interplay between the emotional and physical self. More than a conventional photo book, diafragma invites an embodied experience. To engage with it, the reader must physically interact with the structure—unfolding the pages in multiple directions, touching its textures, and, in a sense, breathing with it.",2025,Signe Fuglesteg Luksengard,,Europe,Global North,https://multipressforlag.com/Signe-Fuglesteg-Luksengard-diafragma

Multipress,Witnesses of an Event,"Collected from a gravel pit at the foot of Hardangervidda, the stones featured in this leporello lay bare and 'unprotected' after being unearthed. The stones hold stories of deep time, speaking of forces beyond our grasp. Through the text 'Here I Am,' written from the stone’s perspective, their journey of formation and transformation is recounted, bearing witness to the earth's violent and evolving forces. The images of clouds, interwoven with the text, serve as a contrast to the stones' solidity, while the accordion structure of the leporello evokes continuity, reflecting the fluid, unbroken flow of time. Together, these elements—the firm, eternal stone and the fleeting, ephemeral clouds—represent time's duality. The images and text present the stones as silent witnesses to the forces that shape both land and life, embodying a sense of existential stability and offering quiet resistance in a world marked by constant crisis.",2024,Mariken Kramer,,Europe,Global North,https://multipressforlag.com/Mariken-Kramer-Witnesses-of-an-Event

In a caring and playful way she has strived to merge a recognizable bodily experience of texture and tactility with a more traditional semiotic visual narrative. The book is printed on 60 g paper, making the images bleed from one side to another and melt together into new previously unseen imagery.

Multipress,Fold Out,"Fold Out, Winkelmann’s 5th monograph, deals with the naked human body of different ages, genders and ethnicities. The body forms the basis for our experience of ourselves and the world. Winkelmann has engaged in close dialogue with various bodies and investigates the extent to which the body can be represented without shame and without the viewer becoming a voyeur. She has wanted to explore the potential of the body as material and the ornamental potential of its forms. Through fragmentation and close studies the book is a search for what the undisguised and uncosmeticized body looks like. The body has always been a political battlefield. Different ways of exercising power and ideologies tame and shape our bodies. Through photographic representation and ideals of self-realization, stereo¬types are produced and confirmed. Most of the bodies we see in public are sexualized and perfected; the naked body unfiltered has come to seem both alien and dangerous. Winkelmann makes us aware of this sense of shame and thus turns the focus on something as unusual as the body with no staging or sales potential.",2022,Verena Winkelmann,,Europe,Global North,https://multipressforlag.com/Verena-Winkelmann-Fold-Out
Nearest Truth Editions,"A hoax, a prank, an internet scam, an act of agricultural bio-terrorism","In July 2020, more than 85.000 US households received packages from China, containing small bags with unsolicited plant seeds. Those 'mystery seeds' sparked biosecurity concerns, and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) warned people not to plant them. Kentucky's agriculture commissioner Ryan Quarles (R) informed the public: 'we don’t have enough information to know if this is a hoax, a prank, an internet scam or an act of agricultural bio-terrorism'. Alongside the official investigation, conservative media and conspiracy theorists entered the discourse with their interpretation of the 'mystery seeds‘ case. Overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic and driven by anti-Chinese sentiment in the heated pre-election period, they claimed the distribution of unsolicited seeds was an attempt of a biological attack. FOX News anchorman Tucker Carlson even suspected they were part of 'China's plan to destroy the United States.' In February 2021, the USDA announced the final results of the investigation on 19,813 packages of unsolicited seeds, which had been sent in by people from all states and contained 515 different species of plants. The actual cause for the unsolicited seeds was identified as a fraud scheme called 'brushing scam', used by Chinese online marketplace sellers to boost their seller rankings. There, the search ranking algorithm of online marketplaces is exploited by sending cheap products to stolen addresses and then submitting positive reviews on the unwitting receiver's behalf.  Based on this understanding, the USDA report stated that there was 'no evidence that someone was intentionally trying to harm U.S. agriculture with these shipments'. However, the 'mystery seeds' case has found its place among conspiracy myths and is still a subject of debate in relevant forums.  The book 'A hoax, a prank, an internet scam, an act of agricultural bio-terrorism' investigates the unfolding of the 'mystery seeds' case and examines the mechanisms behind the emergence  of conspiracy myths and the role of social media in their dissemination. Using the contents of 200 packets from various Chinese online marketplaces, the focus is on the involuntary protagonists of the case: the plant seeds. They are depicted in different stages of growth from seed to seedling to plant, and thus serve as a visual metaphor for how unsubstantiated assumptions can grow into 'alternative facts'. The images are contrasted by screenshots from social networks and quotes, giving insights into the psychology  behind conspiracy myths, the dynamics of the 'post-truth era' and both the manipulative potential and political impact of social media. Book orders for this title will be fulfilled by the artist.",2023,Klaus Pichler,,Europe,Global North,https://www.nearesttrutheditions.com/books/p/a-hoax-a-prank-an-internet-scam-an-act-of-agricultural-bio-terrorism-klaus-pichler
Nearest Truth Editions,The Waning Season,"After the fall of a 30-year dictatorship in 2019, Sudan entered a period of uncertainty—a mix of fragile hope and lingering fear hung in the air. No one realized that this was merely the calm before the storm, a brief respite before the upheaval of 2023 that would shatter all confidence at once. During this fleeting moment of stillness, the photographs for THE WANING SEASON were taken in the capital, Khartoum. Khartoum is located in the heart of Sudan, where the White Nile and the Blue Nile meet, forming the junction of Omdurman to the west, Khartoum to the south, and Bahri to the north. THE WANING SEASON is not a documentary about Khartoum; instead, it provides a subjective reflection from an outsider's viewpoint. It does not seek to offer answers but rather raises additional questions. At times, the city feels dark and cold despite the unyielding brightness and heat. The streets are rough and dusty, with buildings standing as silent witnesses to transience, their walls adorned with painted messages. Everything is at a standstill, a sense of stagnation lingering—a moment suspended before night finally yields to day. The city rests, movement reduced to a whisper. There is little traffic and few people. Years of dictatorship have drained it, leaving it exhausted. The same stillness seeps into its people, where hope feels fragile. And yet, in contrast to this paralysis, there is almost a gentle suggestion regarding Khartoum and its people in their gestures, expressions, and glances, indicating a people with strong will, kindness, and a yearning to continue through the morass that political upheaval serves them. On April 15, 2023, engineers, supervisors, and craftsmen departed the construction site for the final time. That same day, war broke out in Sudan with a brutality few could have imagined. Since then—as of January 2025—200,000 people have lost their lives, over 11 million have been displaced, and more than half of the population now suffers from hunger. This book examines the residents of Khartoum and the uneasy moment before the current season of anxiety, conflict, and loss.",2025,Oliver Gerhartz,,Europe,Global North,https://www.nearesttrutheditions.com/books/p/oliver-gerhartz-the-waning-season
Nearest Truth Editions,"Near 2,143 McDonald’s via Google Street View Looking Elsewhere","This experimental catalog documents the urban landscapes surrounding 5% (more or less) of the world’s McDonald’s outlets. All photos were taken using Google Street View - a fused combination of computer, camera, and car. Each of the 2,143 images depicts a location near a different McDonald’s, spanning 67 countries, including all 50 states of the USA. McDonald’s outlets make for an unstable set of navigation points. They open and close (and occasionally open again), battered by the whims of market forces and international relations. Beyond this, McDonald’s itself - what it offers and what it represents - is not fixed. The McDonald’s on Airport Road in West Jordan, Utah, for instance, is not - practically and symbolically speaking - the same as the McDonald’s on Airport Road in Amman. The meaning of McDonald’s changes depending on audience and context: A fast and cheap meal. A treat. A taste of home. A drive-through. A symbol of globalization, capitalism, and American imperialism. A toilet. Work. A way to end a night out. A drop-off point. A place to sit out of the weather. An erasure. An easy option. Something familiar. Or something else. Read this catalog however you like. Search for places that you recognize. Guess locations, seeking clues in street signs then checking the answers in the back. Or go the other way around, using the index to navigate by place, date, or Subway outlet. Alternatively, move page by page, letting the scenes run together as you watch out the car window. Let your eyes glaze over. Get a little lost. Feel a little queasy.

Nearest Truth Editions,Electricity,"Electricity is Emmanuel Coupe-Kalormiris's first book. The French-Greek artist challenges the urban promiscuity of Athens by interrogating its vast grid. Coupe-Kalomiris examines the hinterlands of the urban environment, seeking light, power, and the strange architecture that keeps the city pulsing. In doing so, he asserts dominion over the city's connectivity. Like Walter Benjamin before him, he becomes a passionate observer lost in the caverns and narrow urban streets of a city's modernism, its nooks and crannies, and its inevitable circulation. Electricity is a book of illuminated fragments. Each monochrome image sparks with the potential to catch fire. Housed in steel and cable wire, the electricity within is an abstraction and a metaphor for life in the post-crisis moment of Athens, the mother of all modern cities.",2024,Manolis Coupe-Kalomiris,,Europe,Global North,https://www.nearesttrutheditions.com/books/p/electricity-emmanuel-coupe
Nearest Truth Editions,The Tower,"Genex Tower, in the Serbian capital of Belgrade, is one of the most iconic buildings in the former Yugoslavia. Consisting of two towers connected by a bridge, the giant brutalist structure looms above the rest of the city, standing stoically as the world changes around it.  Designed in the 1970s by architect Mihajlo Mitrović, the left side of the building consists of 30 floors of residential apartments, while the commercial tower on the right served as the headquarters of the now-defunct trading company Generaleksport, the crown jewel of Yugoslav industry, as one former lawyer for the company put it. The labyrinthian networks of offices in the commercial tower housed Generaleksport's dozens of subsidiary companies, while the restaurant on the top floor was the setting for important business meetings. Today, only two floors are occupied, while the others have become eerie museum displays of the building's past glory and some of its more nefarious secrets. In the residential tower, hundreds of residents have lived out daily routines and personal dramas. It's a place where couples fell in love, teenagers went through rites of passage, a security guard penned a science fiction novella, and a computer engineer painted Mondrians in unexpected corners of the building. More recently, the building has also been used as a set for dozens of films, TV shows and music videos, and a YouTube star created his content in a studio in the building's basement. Despite being laden with a heavy ideological and historical legacy, Genex Tower is impossible to pigeonhole, and its unchanging exterior belies a dynamic interior. 'The Tower' is a subjective documentation of how the past intersects with the present in a place full of possibility.",2024,Xiaofu Wang,,Europe,Global North,https://www.nearesttrutheditions.com/books/p/the-tower-xiaofu-wang
Nearest Truth Editions,One Horse Landed,"Does AI present a world of endless possibility, or a dark and unavoidable end-time for art as we know it? In my new book One Horse Landed, collaboration between artist and machine is recontextualised as a vehicle for wonder, wit and surrealism – a tool with which to interrogate the boundaries of artistic expression. The narrative thread in the work begins with horses, but quickly disentangles itself from the real world. Equine forms devolve, horse and rider metamorphosing into what might be alien lifeforms. A piebald pattern kaleidoscopes outwards. Fragments of parts from industrial machinery seem to rise up from the darkness, exposing broken cables and foam piled up in a surreal underground world. Slowly, this cast of unfamiliar figures becomes one with its new terrain. Within this otherworldly landscape, the viewer finds themselves not only challenging their perception of familiar forms, but also delving into the realm of a speculative future. Human nature compels us to cling to the recognisable, and it is the tension that comes from this searching that spotlights my true subject: the complex choreography between the human imagination and machine interference.",2023,Ben Cole,,Europe,Global North,https://www.nearesttrutheditions.com/books/p/one-horse-landed-ben-cole
Nero,Tarwar,"Ilan Manouach’s Tarwar expands upon the author’s earlier work, Abrégé de bande dessinée franco-belge, but broadens its scope to explore global comics. By leveraging computer vision technologies to study thousands of comics from diverse cultures, Tarwar zeroes in on one recurring visual element: the black panel. These iconic elements, discovered in comics across genres and regions and cultural context all over the world, prompt reflection and signify narrative pauses, often evoking themes of introspection and suspense. Embracing the universality of this motif, Tarwar, entirely composed by black panels, reveals how comics serve as a shared language that transcends geographic, cultural, and stylistic boundaries, creating a collective narrative experience in a globalized world.",2025,Ilan Manouach,,Europe,Global North,https://www.neroeditions.com/product/tarwar/
Nero,Deep Fried Feels,"Deep Fried Feels is a memetic exploration of the contemporary world’s crises—or polycrises, to use an expression made famous by economist Adam Tooze, which emphasizes their interconnected nature—and an attempt to map out the hypercomplex, interlaced cluster*uck that is the world we are living in. Clusterduck draws on memetic poor images found on the fringes of the internet’s dynamic and ever-expanding reservoir of content, transforming these motifs into high-resolution works while simultaneously imitating the distortions and noise of traditional fried memes. The resulting images capture the dissonant, fragmented nature of our shared online existence through a hyper-saturated aesthetic, and each meme/character they represent serves as a representation of the collective emotions—commonly referred to as feels—evoked by local or global polycrises. Chapter by chapter, Deep Fried Feels navigates urgent issues, including the attention economy and data loss, which define and destabilize communication in the digital age, intercepting and reimagining forms of resistance to the ongoing processes of cultural gentrification, searching for spaces of freedom and dissonance.

Nero,The Stream,"Ecstasy and melancholy coexist in Jim C. Nedd’s universe, rooted in moments of social and cultural resistance against the systemic mechanisms of gentrification, shaped by migratory histories like his own, and in the tensions between individual bodies and the social structures that surround them. The Stream is built around a double re-enactment of painter Léon Frédéric’s eponymous triptych, which is a meditation on the profound connection between humanity and nature. Nedd reimagines this iconic work by photographing a group of Neapolitan youths before the imposing waterfall of Conca della Campania, which transcends its role as a scenic backdrop to emerge as a sentient subject, actively engaging with the human bodies around it. Blurring the boundaries between the organic and the inanimate, Nedd moves beyond conventional iconographic dictates, seamlessly blending and reinterpreting elements from diverse iconographic traditions, such as fashion photography, documentary, and tableau vivant. His lens lingers on discrete people and objects, capturing moments suspended in time, which he later reshapes through postproduction crafting a porous, layered reality imbued with magical neorealism—constantly oscillating between performance and spontaneous ritual. Accompanying these and other pictures from the artist’s Neapolitan stay, a series of snapshots, extras, and behind-the-scenes photographs disrupts the dreamlike narrative, anchoring the work in the social and material context of its origin, and pulling the viewer back into the starkness of reality.",2024,Jim C.

NoRoutine Books,Scenes From a Lost Family Album,"Scenes From a Lost Family Album is a deeply personal exploration of memory, loss, and the passage of time. The series emerged from my search for my grandfather’s photo albums—objects tied to my childhood and family history. After years of trying to locate them, I came to accept their disappearance as final. Not long after, I found a stranger’s family album in an antiquarian bookstore in Athens. The photographs it contained—familiar poses, domestic scenes, gatherings—eerily mirrored my own memories. Through embroidery, I reimagined these found images alongside fragments of my past. Each stitch acts as a quiet attempt to reclaim what was lost, while also acknowledging the universal language of family and nostalgia. This work is a meditation on the fragility of memory and the emotional resonance of what we leave behind.",2025,Triin Kerge,,Europe,Global North,http://www.nrb.lt/
NoRoutine Books,29 Landscapes,"Our perceptions of landscapes are influenced by cultural and social factors, and our fears and anxieties towards certain landscapes are rooted in our own subjective experiences. This collection of 29 silver gelatin dry-plate photographs explores the human relationship with the landscape, from natural scenery to urban and industrial settings. The use of the handmade silver gelatin dryglass plate technique, with some plates left intentionally unwashed to create contamination inside the emulsion itself, adds a layer of complexity to the images, highlighting the human impact on the environment. The inclusion of archival materials from the surface of Mars and early atmospheric nuclear testing footage further emphasises the connection between human activity and the landscape. Despite the varied subjects depicted, all of them are connected by the line of the horizon, representing the unity and interconnectedness of the landscape, regardless of our own subjective experiences. Through this collection, viewers are invited to reflect on their own relationship with the world around them and consider the impact of human activity on the environment. The natural landscapes evoke a sense of calm and serenity, even though they could turn the opposite way in an instant, while the industrial and nuclear images may provoke discomfort or unease. The human impact on the environment can take many forms, such as deforestation, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction. Even seemingly pristine natural landscapes are often affected by factors such as air and water pollution, invasive species, and climate change. This means our relationship with the environment is becoming increasingly complex and intertwined and that we must take steps to mitigate and adapt to the effects of human activity on the natural world.",2023,Armands Andže,,Europe,Global North,http://www.nrb.lt/

Seeking to make visible an otherwise invisible threat to the biosphere, contributed from analogue photographic image-making, I slowly create a layer of water on light-sensitive photographic paper and carefully inject the chemicals into it. For me, it serves as a comprehensive gesture, where the aesthetics of hand-made pollution are revealed. Where a watery blue becomes golden. It’s a gaze and a movement of my hand that recognises water as a universal solvent, treats it as a source of life and transformation and acknowledges it as a collector of chemical waste. Whether it is from large-scale production or one activity, a contaminated substance is created that finds its way back to us through its flow. There is no way we can avoid our contribution to the ecosystem. No matter how small. But neither can we avoid photographs of this kind exploiting the chemical and physical reactions of physical phenomena themselves.

Northing / Kinakaal forlag,Bird of Paradise,"The book Bird of Paradise began with an encounter between artist Anne Tveit Knutsen and the late florist Rikhard Rune Juuhl (1952–2023), who had already fallen into the clutches of Parkinson’s disease and dementia. Drawing on the empathy and caregiving instinct from her previous work as a nurse, Anne developed her brief friendship with the gradually fading florist into a poignant project centred on the trinity of old age, floristry, and fine art. The book gathers essays by well-established artists, philosophers, sociologists, and art historians, each exploring these themes from their own perspective and area of expertise. Designer Yilei Wang subtly embedded the connection between the three elements in the design details—such as the lenticular cover featuring negative images of withdrawing roots, and the page edges, which shift in colour from green to yellow.

Northing / Kinakaal forlag,Debt Verses,"Ours is a world in which debt is foundational: credit lines pay for housing, or in education systems pay for student loans. More positively, debt can be seen as an obligation, as the acts and deeds we owe one another to reinforce the social fabric. Miriam Stoney explores the many senses of debt in a new poem commissioned for the triennial art event Bergen Assembly 2022 - Yasmine and the Seven Faces of the Heptahedron.Borrowing from ancient and contemporary narratives from around the world, as well as trivia, popular culture, and psychoanalytic and critical theory, Stoney’s poem explores the role of debt and indebtedness in its relational, monetary, moral, and creative dimensions. Written from the perspective of the Fortune Teller, the work tells the story of the articulations, (mis)understandings, and intuitions about debt. Stoney’s text explores how debt is a kind of curse (such as a fortune teller might issue), and how credit and debit are fundamental organising belief systems. After all, our relationships to the past, present, and future are formatted by debt—things we are owed, or things we owe others—and these often make the future a space of worry. Can debt, then, serve as a way of predicting the future?  Debt Verses is published in the form of a trilingual poetry book. Kinakaal forlag designed the book and inventively arrange the three languages, English (original), Chinese, and Norwegian, into one leporello bond book with two spines that close and open by magnets.

This hard-cover book incorporates Chalayan’s fashion collections, video works and paintings from 1994 to 2020, which manifest the possible collisions between history and traditions with new technologies, trend of thoughts and social formations. Chalayan once stated that he wanted to create a sense of life for the clothes., which is also a symbol of this era characterized with dynamics, relentless migrations and adaptations of identities.",2022,Gong Yan,,Europe,Global North,https://www.northing.no/elephanten/p/hussein-chalayan-archipelago-1

His keen observations have discovered the many office chairs being put outdoor in Taiwan, where people use them for chat or for nap. These outgoing chairs seem to enjoy better life, and more freedom, instead of leading a well-planned but boring office life. Jolivet’s amusing chair photos are now collected in this tiny pocket book. The first edition of Out Of Office was self-published by Jolivet in 2021, including only 8 chair photos, in a limited print run of 20.

Not just a collective,Our Silver Lining,"This publication originated in the summer of 2018, right after I graduated from the university of the Arts, Utrecht (NL). In that period I often lacked the right motivation, space and time to make work, and filming and photographing with my mobile phone turned out to be the perfect way to continue to make work in an accessible way. Under the working title 'OBSERVATIONS' I collected --the working title says it all-- everyday observations, which I eventually brought together in a video of the same name. This video was previously shown during Museum Night 2019 in Amsterdam. I initially did not take this way of working so seriously, but now it has become an indispensable part of my practice; 'Our Silver Lining' is an ever growing collection of everyday moments. All videos and photos are unstaged and shot with an iPhone 8 between the summer of 2018 and the summer of 2020, in various locations around the world. The title of this project refers to a text I came accross a house in Ostend (BE), during a family weekend in the fall of 2018. According to some a cliché, but I experienced this as a piece of poetry you sometimes just stumble upon. At the end of 2020, the idea arose to bring all the collected material together in one publication. In order to realize this, I collaborated with graphic designer and good friend Fabian Hamacher. In addition to my collaboration with Fabian, I also sought collaboration with author Jan Zwaaneveld. Inspired by my work, Jan wrote the text ‘All that we don’t see', a collection of fragments and scenes that struck him from everyday life. So you could say that we work in a similar way, but only choose a different medium. Judie Ellington provided the English translation of this text. Ideally, this publication will be the first in a series, which I want to (self)publish on an irregular basis, showing a new selection of this archive every time. By working in this way I force myself to take the images out my phone and look at my work with more critically.",2021,Maite Vanhellemont,"51.9851, 5.8987",Europe,Global North,http://notjustacollective.nl/#/archive/Q1VJtsCuB18fwvZ3xyVq

Through researched online videos and images, it reflects the behavioral tendencies of women in Asian countries and the roots of these tendencies. In Cuteness, Areum Hwang presents a thought-provoking examination of the cultural forces that shape the expectations and experiences of women in Asian societies. Through a deep investigation of videos on mainstream platforms, Hwang formulated how these normative digital fragments infiltrate gender expectations into the minds of Asian women. By using a glitch-like visual presentation, she critiques the toxic normativity of aesthetics towards women in Asian mass culture, and reveals the pervasive influence of patriarchal norms on the way Asian women are expected to behave and present themselves. At its core, Cuteness is a powerful critique of the gender expectations that women in Asian countries are subjected to on a daily basis. Through her insightful commentary and well-researched sources, Hwang sheds light on the ways in which these expectations are deeply rooted in patriarchal values and ideas, and how they shape the way women are perceived and valued by others.",2022,Areum Hwang,"51.9851, 5.8987",Europe,Global North,http://notjustacollective.nl/#/archive/fluIHN09CSdS1XVolzJw
OAZA Books,On Witches (Is she just too old for this?) ,"The artist book On Witches (Is she just too old for this?) by Sanja Iveković is based on her 2013 art project Is She Too Old for This? (On Witches), which draws from Silvia Federici’s Caliban and the Witch (2004). Federici explores the witch hunts of the early modern period, connecting them to the rise of capitalism and colonialism, and pointing out how this topic is often overlooked in traditional Marxist discussions of primitive accumulation. Through a series of collages, Iveković bridges the past and present, asking the question of who today’s witches are. She places particular emphasis on the link between society's imagination of witches and the idea of old age, investigating how women who don’t fit conventional standards of youth and beauty are perceived. The collages in this book challenge us to rethink how society defines women and their power at different stages of life. In addition to the visual work, the book includes texts that serve as a tribute to some of Croatia’s most prominent feminists, such as Slavenka Drakulić, Rada Iveković, Vesna Kesić, Jelena Lovrić and Dubravka Ugrešić.",2024,Sanja Iveković,,Europe,Global North,https://oazabooks.com/?page=books&book=on-witches

OAZA Books,Phugoid Cycle,"This illustrated book delves into the intricate task of reconstructing and appropriating the life of Armando Nieto, whose story met a tragic end in 1979 in Bogota. Seamlessly blending elements of truth with imaginative fiction, the author draws from personal childhood memories—moments tinged with both profound despair and fleeting glimpses of hope. Additionally, the author delves into dreams of the future, explorations of love and sexuality, and a multifaceted imagination that continues to challenge him. Through the lens of Armando's formative years, the narrative also navigates themes of future aspirations, the complexities of love and sexuality, and a layered imagination that remains both a source of solace and struggle. At its core, the tale illuminates the dual nature of desire: a deep-seated yearning for genuine connection juxtaposed against a mercurial, often relentless, obsession. At the moment when Armando Nieto did what he did that morning in 1979, I was only one year old and lived in Medellin, where I was born, and my brother Santiago was only a few months old. My mother quit her job, and my father worked for an American company established by William Burroughs' grandson, selling computers that are now museum pieces. A few months ago, I read Armando's story and felt an immediate connection, not because I don't respect my parents (although, sometimes, I admit, I became so obsessed with them that I lost sight of my respect for them) but mainly because I felt similarities between us that revealed the strange and complex nature of childhood. I say I felt this because I don't know more about Armando than what he wanted to do that morning at the age of twenty-four, which some news notes immediately associated with mental illness, abuse, and depression. However, what I want to do is imagine his childhood and adolescence, beyond the yellow headlines in the press and the post-traumatic stress that hit Bogota that morning in 1979.

Oficyna Peryferie,WE. Life Between East and West,"I grew up in the countryside near a district town in the 1990s. Poland looked different back then. There weren't many elements that would define our belonging to the West – for example, McDonald's. I treat this now-banal chain restaurant as a symbol of the aspirations of the early Third Polish Republic. It was desired not only by children from small towns, but also by the political and cultural elites of the time. At the time when the first McDonald's was opening in Poland, the chain was criticized in the West for the low quality of its products, blamed for causing obesity and contributing to the enlargement of the ozone hole by clearing forests for pastures. Along with McDonald's, its criticism was imported to Poland. Anarchists, alter-globalists, and environmental organizations protested against subsequent locations. Opposition to the chain restaurant was one of the slogans of the subcultures of the time, present on popular patches, T-shirts, and stickers, a set of which I will also present. Interestingly, when in 1992 With the opening of the first McDonald's, we entered the West, while the East was bustling right next door. In the center of Warsaw, near the Palace of Culture and Science, a marketplace was starting to open, where people from the collapsing USSR traded. This is brilliantly documented in Tadeusz Pałka's film In the Shadow of the Palace. In the 1990s, we lived between the West and the East. Today, it seems that we are somewhere else.

PRODUCTION – everything you need to know about the creative aspect – printing techniques, bookbinding, papers, circulation, formats, imposition, materials and equipment. MONEY – or do you need it, why and how much, how to get it and what to spend it on… and how to do it legally? DISTRIBUTION – or how to reach the audience in a way that makes sense and doesn’t waste the energy invested in production? CONTEXTS – how to deal with criticism, avoid copyright infringement and what is the general history of zines? This book is intended for both beginners and professionals. It shows amateurs how to get started and what can be done, while it helps professionals take a fresh look at publishing and break out of the confines of professionalism. This book is a knowledge pill based on the author's many years of experience as a creator and publisher, hundreds of workshops conducted in Poland and abroad, and years of teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts.

Other Editions,The City Is Ours #3: Superficial Damages,"The walls of the buildings, sidewalks, and streets in the city are in contact with a wide variety of users, uses, and activities: people walking, parents running with strollers, bikes suddenly braking, skateboarders practicing their tricks, scooters and cars being driven at full speed, and much more. All of these activities inevitably leave behind traces on the material surfaces, such as scratches, marks, and cracks. These traces of wear are often seen as something negative. But if we look at them with a more open mind, what can scratches and other superficial forms of damage found in the city tell us?

Fascinated by cities and by semiotics, SerraGlia decided to create an artistic and slightly ironic visual statement about these found signs. He is not seeking to reveal their absolute truth. Instead, He wants to question our perception of our surroundings. Are things always as they seem?

But when it was turned off, he soon started to notice curious traces of his fingerprints on the screen. At first look, these traces look like abstract paintings or drawings done without a plan. But if we look at them carefully, they can actually reveal more than what they seem. In fact, every trace is left after a logical and rational sequence of gestures: from writing an email to browsing a webpage, the finger traces left on a device's screen follow your precise intentions and actions.

Other Forms,Systems and their Discontents,"Beginning in the 1990s, the efflorescence of a technology-driven, ostensibly post-industrial new economy brought with it a revival of interest in an array of concepts and discourses relating systems and systems thinking that had animated both progressive utopian projects of the 1960s and 70s and the totalizing global geopolitical schemas of the Cold War. The theme for this issue of Counter-Signals began as an attempt to assemble a reappraisal of this reappraisal of cybernetics and systems theory that, it was hoped, would offer critical perspectives to counter the uncritical affirmation that characterized much of architecture and design discourse. However, as the call propagated outwards through a world still very much in the grip of capitalism’s grim cycle of expansion, crisis, and consolidation, which Gramsci observed in the 1930s, much of the optimism and exuberance hardened and darkened in ways strikingly similar to the trajectory of the original discourses of the 70s and then 80s. The theme therefore expanded into wider fields of systematicity and a more complex, though no less urgent and acute, constellation of discontents. Paradoxically, and perhaps now optimistically, these many points of protest and critique appear to offer hope for a future, however difficult, of continuing intransigence, refusal, and resistance. The structures are hard, the systems are total, the abstractions are real but so too is the struggle.",2024,"Alan Smart, Jack Henrie Fisher",,North America,Global North,https://otherforms.net/product/systems-and-their-discontents/
Other Forms,Class is formed through the language of class struggle,"suddenly, however, there arises the voice of the worker, which had previously been stifled in the sound and fury of the production process. Capital, 342 Bini Adamczak writes Class is formed through the language of class struggle and in it, through struggle, the abolition of class becomes foreseeable. Following this line of thought, we might say that class itself is formed through language, but not just any language: the peculiar language that is produced in class struggle. Within the terms of this particular language — and in conjunction with struggles that are not reducible to language — the very abolition of class, the horizon of which the language itself presupposes, becomes possible. This publication gives form to linguistic material taken from the rich but disparate, sideways and non-unified corpus of marxian linguistic theory, which includes accounts of metaphor, slogans, and the way action and language are linked. Analytic philosophy fails to theorize this.",2023,Jack Henrie Fisher,,North America,Global North,https://otherforms.net/product/class-is-formed-through-the-language-of-class-struggle/
Other Forms,Loving the Highline,"As an elevated rail line, designed to lift freight trains serving the Hudson River docks above street level circulation, The High Line was originally constructed as material infrastructure for an industrial city. It was closed in 1960s and stood abandoned for the next forty years. In this time organic debris accumulated and decayed, and seeds landed on the newly forming soil creating a meadow on the derelict railbed. This microcosmic biome then also became a heterotopic, other space, in the social ecology of the city as an efflorescence of new art forms and underground subcultures flourished in the evacuated post-industrial spaces of Chelsea. These processes would unfold as New York City was being transformed into a global center in an emerging political-economy defined by the integration of finance capital with media and information industries. In this, marginal spaces of the kind that developed in Chelsea, and the cultures that create them, became important sources of new aesthetic and cultural innovation, that offer an exploitable social ground from which to extract semiotic value. As the Bloomberg administration gave shape to this new regime, a project was initiated to convert the High Line into a publicly accessible, linear park. This would be realized through a convoluted process in which the manifold tensions and contradictions of the postmodern city would be dramatically played out and the disjunctions between ideal image regimes and the reality of the material substrates that support them would be brought to light, if only to be newly obscured. The High Line urban park has been both heralded as a definitive model for new urban development, and denounced as a driver, or at least a morbid symptom, of devastating gentrification, and the destructive financialization of urban space. This text, originally published in 2015 as part of the Deconstructing the High Line anthology, edited by Mark Linder and Brian Rosa, tracks a collection of interconnected historical treads that converge in the reconstruction of the High Line, and situates the project within architectural discourse and practice, and social and material conditions with which it struggles to engage.",2022,Alan Smart,,North America,Global North,https://otherforms.net/product/loving-the-highline/
Other Forms,Prefaces to Communication and Class Struggle,"This small pamphlet aims to recirculate the two prefaces from Seth Siegelaub’s epic and out-of-print anti-capitalist anthologies Communication and Class Struggle. The texts reprinted here make timely interventions into a theory of communication and should be read again today for a number of reasons, not least for the indirect illumination they might cast on the algorithmic domination of our own late capitalist moment, in which forms of electronic media appear both utterly obscure in their relation to contents of political struggle, as well as unbreakably monopolistic. More hopefully, these texts might also help us to recognize the emergence of new (or newly obsolete) media forming in resistance to these electronic monopolies and to grasp their tactical significance in the current terms of revolutionary struggle. In these prefaces, Siegelaub’s sense of his particular vocation — specialized, amateur, committed — is moving and exemplary. The subject he imagines in his prefaces — and the comrade he implicitly addresses — is the leftwing publisher/theorist/archivist embattled in class struggle, without the space, money, time, or indeed attention to make serious non-ephemeral editions of anti-capitalist communication theory, let alone full and accurate bibliographical references.",2022,"Seth Siegelaub, Jack Henrie Fisher",,North America,Global North,https://otherforms.net/product/prefaces-to-communication-and-class-struggle/
Other Forms,c\a\n\a\d\a delineating nation state capitalism,"c\a\n\a\d\a: delineating nation state capitalism aims to connect two critical discourses about space that have so far been disassociated: architectural theories that point to the importance of real property as the fundamental unit of urban morphology and architectural typology, and Indigenous land claims which point to the violence of colonial land dispossession, through which this property was originally invented and formed. This research sees property delineation as a fundamental grammatical logic of the production of the space of nation, state and capital. Nisga’a architect luugigyoo patrick reid stewart, who is interviewed in this volume, underlines this fact when he likens the grammar of the English language to the striation of colonial land appropriation. To counter the violence of this colonial language, he writes without periods or capitals, and spells Canada, a word derived from the Iroquoian word kanata, meaning settlement, with backward slashes between each of its letters, a critical spelling that literally illustrates the fragmentation of land produced through the delineation of colonial land appropriation. The editors and contributors to this volume approach this intersection of Indigenous and settler viewpoints, as well as the interdisciplinary perspectives of both spatial delineators and critical commentators, in order to understand the deep connections between Indigenous dispossession and urban pathologies of gentrification, homelessness, systemically biased planning and urban alienation. Finally, contributors to this issue address this connection in order to rethink and redraw land relations as a foundation for undoing this alienation and creating spaces that cultivate a caring relation with land, kin and strangers.",2022,David Fortin and Adrian Blackwell,,North America,Global North,https://otherforms.net/product/scapegoat-12-13/
Other Forms,"Typography, Automation, and the Division of Labor: A Brief History","Typography was born in the mass-production mechanism of the printing press. It has thus always been implicated in automation—and, thereby, in the distinctly modern dynamics of overwork, underemployment, and runaway production. In this compact illustrated essay, J. Dakota Brown reinterprets the history of graphic design by situating it in the history of capitalism. Beginning in the early industrial era, Typography, Automation, and the Division of Labor: A Brief History traces the rise of the design professions alongside the gradual fragmentation and decline of the printing trades. Along the way, Brown re-reads the trajectory of the modernist machine aesthetic as a series of historically-specific reactions to the changing economic and technical realities of typographical practice. This dual contribution to labor history and design history incorporates the crisscrossing perspectives of design professionals and production workers, modernists and postmodernists, bosses and union reps, and materialist thinkers from Adam Smith to El Lissitzky.",2019,J.

Other Forms,Scapegoat 11: Life,"Architectural modernity is an emphatically secular modernity that imagines itself to have been recently liberated from an age in which architecture was a metaphysical discipline, and whose architectural forms were constrained by the metaphysical requirements of the king or the church. Today, architects do not see themselves as metaphysicians, and yet there is unfinished metaphysical business at the core of the modern project that continually undermines this narrative of liberation. Hidden within the new rationalist core of architectural modernity is the old western metaphysical distinction between life and non-life — the living and the non-living — which in the 21st century has increasingly become a site of political struggle in the built environment, linking struggles over reproductive rights, environmental justice, climate change, archaeology, and urban design. In the LIFE issue we find evidence of architecture’s ongoing metaphysical work in the use of architectural building codes as a tool to limit women’s reproductive choices in Texas, the US military’s conversion of the Aleutian archipelago into its own private radiation sensor, the management of racialized ghosts in Indonesian squatter settlements, the rise of neo-vitalist urbansim in Europe, and the introduction of the logic of automation into burial practices in Tokyo.",2018,Marcin Kędzior and Seth Denizen,,North America,Global North,https://otherforms.net/product/scapegoat-11-life/

Other Forms,Volcanoes of the CapitaloceneCities and Landscapes of the Second Industrial Revolution,"During the rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union’s first five-year plan, the city of Magnitogorsk was built on a sparsely inhabited site in the Western Siberian steppe marked by a geological anomaly: a mountain of almost pure iron ore. In the rhetoric of Soviet planners and the European modernist architects who had come east to help build a new world, Magnitogorsk was to manifest the ideal of Socialist City in being organized completely by production such that the linearity of the assembly line, and the processes of steel making would extend into the kitchens and bedrooms of the workers and drive the creation of a new culture. The design and construction of Magnitogorsk’s mills and the planning of its urban infrastructure was, however, largely directed by American consulting engineers with whom Soviet officials had made contact during the courses of a trade mission, which had toured the northern Midwest. The model they had been asked to reproduce was not the ideal Socialist City but a very real Capitalist one: that of Gary Indiana. Begun little more than twenty years before Magnitogorsk, Gary was also very much a planned utopia in which a city had been built around the economic and social engine the US Steel, Gary works. The site chosen for Gary had also appeared empty to its founders, but been charged with potential by its geographic location. While Magnitogorsk had extractable resources, Gary was situated so as to be a prime node in a logistics network drawing material from across the North American continent. Gary was also invested with intense ideological significance and would become a space in which the construction and social engineering of American urban/industrial culture, with all of its conflicts, contradictions and brutal inequities, would be played out in stark terms. Volcanoes of the Capitalocene compares the development and transformation of these two linked cites as they exist as points of often mutually-constituting interpenetration between the natural world and its time sales, and the shock and rupture of the built worlds of technology, ideology, capital and human culture.

Outer Space Press,£146,"Claudio Pogos’ £ 146,- presents a compelling and provocative engagement with the intersection of erotic imagery, digital commodification, and the politics of ownership. The photobook draws on found vintage erotica, sourced from eBay auctions, and appropriates these intimate photographs in a commentary on censorship, value, and control. What sets the book apart is Pogos’ engagement with the photographs’ pre-existing marks: the eBay seller’s decision to place British pound coins over the genitalia of the subjects, ostensibly for protection against unauthorized reproduction. This act of censorship—simultaneously crude and absurd—becomes the focal point of Pogos’ work. The coins, bearing the face of Queen Elizabeth II, are not merely functional but have a conceptual weight that transforms the images into something far more complex. The seller’s placement of these coins, which is as much an act of safeguarding as it is an absurd gesture, takes on a new life in Pogos’ hands. Ultimately, £ 146,- challenges its viewers to reflect on the ways in which value is assigned, bodies are controlled, and art is protected in the digital realm. Pogo creates a visually striking narrative that speaks to the complex, often uncomfortable intersections of sex, power, and commerce.",2024,Claudio Pogos,,Europe,Global North,https://www.outerspacepress.com/product/146

Outer Space Press,Only the plants will ever know,"The book combines two stories, which run parralel within the narrative and create a visual dialog with each other: a collection of 25 found negatives and a series of photographs found in ‘The Great Plant Dictionary’ originally published in 1972. The selection of those photographs was inspired by the story of one of the biggest, most rare and intriguing plants in the world—Amorphophallus Titanum, which translates as ‘giant misshapen penis’ —also commonly known as the Corpse Flower. Hardly any of these plants exist in cultivation and their blooms are both extremely rare and unpredictable—occuring only once in a decade and lasting only up to two days. When the blooming begins the flower exposes it’s fleshy coloured inner tube structure and emits a signature stench. The viewing of the flowering Corpse Plant was forbidden to young women by English governesses when one of the first plants of this type began to bloom for the first time in UK. A little cardboard box found by chance in summer of 2020 contains a collection of black and white slides, which show rephotographed pages of a porn magazine with a stamped date of 20th of July 1970. Looking through these amateur photographs is an intimate experience of viewing the bespoke magazine pages through someone else’s eyes. The act of visual and material transformation by Wysocka and Pogo is reclaiming this view. The images are further cropped, reframed and reorganised in a meticulous way to then be reprinted using artists’ own developed technique— a distortion of the offset and risograph printed sheets in an effort to recreate a uniquely textured, soft, metallic graphite impressions, which resemble the look and feel of the original slides.",2021,"Magdalena Wysocka, Claudio Pogo",,Europe,Global North,https://www.outerspacepress.com/product/only-the-plants-will-ever-know

PASAJ,Future has Desires,"Future has Desires is a research-based project that investigates the nature and structure of being a collective. With the pandemic period, a new understanding of coexistence emerges, leading up to a new type of discussion on the need and condition of collectivity in today’s world. Now, in this new state where everything can be questioned and shaken from its root as Bruno Latour states*, this can be an opportunity to question the current contemporary art scene and even a perfect time to express our common desire to change it and to unite around this desire. In this project, we would like to investigate further questions such as: - What is the nature and conditions of the collectivity today?- What are the ways of organizing new associations, setting collective decision-making processes, and acting together? - How does collective work continue in the long run? - Why do members of a collective leave the group after they line up with their common goals? This one-year research project consists of four chapters: Literature review focusing not only on art writings but also those from the fields of philosophy, sociology, and psychology; Survey created for collective working groups to fill in; Online meetings with the matched groups and specified contents as a result of the survey, and finally, Book consisting of the transcription of the meetings from audio to text that would be pieced together as a final product. Each step is complementary: the previous step will add elements to the content of the next step. The program will be developed together with participants from Turkey and nearby geography. It is desired to bring together structures that are similar in social, economic, and political tensions, that can mutually try the methods they apply and the solutions they reach, and that can adapt to their own conditions. Apart from these collectives cited above, it is planned to invite other collective structures to the project as a result of the survey phase. The program has a flow suggested by PASAJ, the whole process is open to be shaped by common decisions. Nil Mutluer in the field of sociology, İpek Altun in the field of psychology, and Leila Haghighat in the field of philosophy support research.

PEARS,PEARS Magazine Issue 3,"For this third edition, we turned our attention to the moving image—those flickering stories that kept us company, sparked our imaginations, and drew us closer. This issue celebrates how stories move us—and move through us—while also asking lingering questions: What will happen to movie theaters now that streaming is the norm? And why do women’s stories so often feel one-dimensional? We’re also thrilled to feature profiles of two inimitable women in the Indonesian film industry: Tatjana Saphira and Ratu Felisha. On the surface, they couldn’t be more different—Tatjana, with her familiar warmth and quiet strength, and a name often associated with drama films; Ratu, bold and candid, known for her striking presence in horror movies. But as our writer Inaya Pananto sat down with each of them, she discovered a shared thread: a fierce passion for storytelling and a quiet resilience in navigating an industry that still isn’t always built to support women. Through open, generous conversations, they reflected on their creative processes, the pressures they face, and what lies ahead in both their personal and professional lives.",2025,,,Southeast Asia,Global South,https://pearsmag.com/Issue-3-25

Perimeter Editions,Fruiting Bodies,"Ying Ang’s Fruiting Bodies reimagines the mushroom as both a biological form and a feminist metaphor – an emergent, generative force that challenges dominant narratives of fertility and the female body. Photographed while walking through inner-city parks close to the artist’s home in Melbourne, the series examines how the fetishisation of fertility has shaped cultural perceptions of women, nature and reproduction, questioning whether growth and abundance must always serve a reproductive imperative. Ang’s photographs capture mushrooms in various states of emergence: solitary and erect; clustered in intimate pairs; decaying and dispersing spores. In these images, the fruiting body becomes an uncanny stand-in for the female form – soft yet resilient, sensuous, and categorically enigmatic. The undulating stems and textured caps – the act of pushing through and returning to the earth – evoke the eroticised, reproductive framing of the female body in art and culture, yet they also resist it. Unlike traditional fertility symbols that reinforce womanhood as a vessel for production, these mushrooms thrive in cycles of decay and renewal, blurring the boundaries between birth, death, and transformation. Certain schools of evolutionary theory discuss the role of postmenopausal women, by reframing aging not as biological redundancy but as a vital stage of life that sustains and enriches communities, arguing that their continued existence beyond childbearing years serves a critical function: to pass on knowledge, wisdom, and cultural memory. Similarly, Fruiting Bodies – Ang’s first book for Perimeter Editions – finds power in the non-reproductive phases of life. Just as mycelium persists unseen beneath the forest floor, feeding, connecting, and shaping ecosystems, women beyond fertility continue to shape society in profound ways. Ecofeminist scholars have long argued that patriarchal systems exploit both the earth and the female body through the same logic – one that demands constant output, control, and utility. Fruiting Bodies responds to this by embracing the fungal model: a form of fertility that is rhizomatic rather than hierarchical; collective rather than possessive; disruptive rather than obedient. Here, Ang challenges the fetishisation of fertility and proposes a different kind of reproductive power – one that is intellectual, communal, and ever-evolving.",2025,Ying Ang,"-37.8136, 144.9631",Oceania,Global North,

Perimeter Editions,Conditioned,"Conditioned draws upon key series from the last decade to prise open histories and imaginaries that simmer between Indigenous and European experiences, perspectives, and consciousness. Cook works in an almost cinematic mode, using the camera as an elaborate choreographic and narrative device, meticulously layering and editing his images from countless shoots on location. The resulting images are quietly virtuosic. Soft, painterly tones and fastidious compositional details provide a filmic backdrop for historical pathos, speculative futures, imaginary leaps, and unrestrained what-ifs. They veer between the sumptuous and the stark, the historical and the speculative, the political and the playful. Amidst Conditioned’s lushly printed plates – which are punctuated by abstracted texts and phraseology – Cook invites us on a kaleidoscopic trip through Indigenous parliamentary takeovers, luxury European shopping sprees, autobiographic asides, and colonial inversions – where Aboriginal characters assume the role of alien invaders, and supersized Australian wildlife wreak havoc upon iconic London streets. It is a journey of reflection, resistance, and freewheeling imagination.",2025,Michael Cook,"-37.8136, 144.9631",Oceania,Global North,https://perimetereditions.com/CONDITIONED
Perimeter Editions,Auto-Photo: A Life in Portraits,"Very little about the photobooth experience has changed since its inception in the early twentieth century. There is a particular charm to its inherent simplicity and repetition. The framing is fixed, as is the lighting, backdrop, and time between photographs. Only we, the subject, are the ones that change.Auto-Photo: A Life in Portraits tells the story of Alan Adler, a man who is likely the most photographed person in Australia, and is also perhaps the oldest and longest-serving photobooth technician in the world. For more than fifty years, Adler maintained a suite of photobooths across Melbourne/Naarm – most notably, at a site near Flinders Street Station – and would undertake weekly testing and servicing on each photobooth across his network. To ensure the focus, flash, and print quality were all up to standard at the end of each service, Adler would take a seat in the booth and produce a test strip of photographs. Through these weekly tests, Adler produced an archive of thousands upon thousands of photographs. While his decades-long operation has contributed to the photography of over a million people, these self-portraits are the only surviving record of Adler’s life’s work – a tangible document of his role in maintaining the photobooth tradition. The images that appear in Auto-Photo, which span from the 1970s to the 2010s, give us clues about the person who inhabits them, along with the passing of time. Adler’s gappy grin, comedic expressions, and pet cats intermingle with shifting fashions, retro colour film tints, and an increasing crinkling around the eyes. In 2018, with the booth at Flinders Street Station facing imminent closure, Christopher Sutherland and Jessie Norman – whose operation later became known as Metro-Auto-Photo – began working with Adler to generate interest in his work and to successfully save his photobooth. Now in his nineties, Adler has since sold his photobooths to Metro-Auto-Photo, who have compiled this publication with the CCP and Perimeter to illuminate Adler, his unique collection, and his impact on Australia’s photography history.",2024,,"-37.8136, 144.9631",Oceania,Global North,https://perimetereditions.com/AUTO-PHOTO-A-LIFE-IN-PORTRAITS
Perimeter Editions,On Country: Photography from Australia,"‘Country’ is a term embodied by First Peoples in Australia to describe the lands, waterways, seas and cosmos to which they are connected. It represents Ancestral ties to a place, and the living cultural presence of that place, and references the complex relationship land has to language, family and identity. Being ‘on Country’ is more than just being situated somewhere, it is about being shaped by that place, connected to it, and having a responsibility to care for it. Australia has a complex history that is underpinned by over 60,000 years of continuous and unceded First Peoples connection – comprising over 250 different language groups or ‘countries’. There has since been over two centuries of colonisation, whereby settler and diaspora communities have made the continent their home. The nation is a shared space of multifaceted histories and stories, and although colonialism has attempted to suppress First Nations People, their culture has continued and is strong and living today. In contrast to its historic use as an early tool for ethnographic documentation in Australia, the artists in the exhibition and its corresponding publication embrace photography as a medium for truth telling, self-determination and collaboration, both acknowledging the past and suggesting possible futures. Co-published by PHOTO Australia and Perimeter Editions, On Country: Photography from Australia presents artists who connect to Country in dynamic ways and are shifting the power dynamics inherent in photography, redefining photographic practice on this southern land.",2025,,"-37.8136, 144.9631",Oceania,Global North,https://perimetereditions.com/ON-COUNTRY-Photography-from-Australia

Throughout history, hair has been charged with significance and is resonant with meaning, transmitting ideas about gender, mythology, status and power, the body, psychology, feminism, and notions of beauty. At once radiant and repellent, and often richly symbolic, it has always assumed a particular importance in relation to the self, history, and society. Edited by Melissa Keys, Hair Pieces explores the complex significance of hair in contemporary culture through a selection of recent Australian and international works of art. Encompassing a wide range of practices including drawing, painting, performance, photography, installation, text, and more, this collection of works reveals interwoven dialogues tracing identity, spirituality, agency, and resistance.

"Printed Matter, Inc",When Eye Land,"The project builds on Feliz’s research-based installation work, wading into memory, intimacy, and the ancestral past to explore how the legacy of colonialism has shaped the national identity of the Dominican Republic. What gets left behind when identity and belonging is removed from a relationship to land and spirit, shaped instead within the white European patriarchal imagination? How does colonialism live and breathe in our cells and psyche, taking root in the subconscious like a spell? Who is the Dominican land? Assembled from historical texts and photos, colonial maps, fabulated letters, and the artist’s own family albums, When Eye Land confronts the twisted colonial visions of the Western gaze in Hispaniola in the late 19th and early 20th century. The publication unravels desire seated in the eye of the tourist, scientist and explorer, reflecting on how the constructed landscape (the Land Columbus Loved as National Geographic puts it) is formed by spiritual, socio-political, ecological, and cognitive processes. Across this material the publication shows us indigenous life and its violent encounters with Spanish rule, agricultural workers, Santo Domingo’s early industry, and export crops like plantain, cashew fruit, and sugarcane. Select images are transformed with an underprinting of gold pantone ink, offering gilded adornments like those you might find in an old scrapbook. The project offers a way to re-address the cultural mythologies and commodification of the Arawak-Taino original peoples of the Caribbean, and elevate the lives of Black and rural poor hidden from view. It reflects on a brutal past, lived contemporary reality, and how we might conjure other worlds ahead. When Eye Land concludes with an afterword by artist and writer manuel arturo abreu that builds on the project’s themes within their own experience of economic precarity, generational secrets, and transmissions from the ancestral realm.

"Printed Matter, Inc",Depreciating Assets,"Depreciating Assets is a new artists’ book by Jessica Vaughn investigating labor, diversity politics, and the material environment of the American workplace. With a new lens to the artist’s multidisciplinary practice, the project examines how affirmative action and other office equity measures are intersected by corporate infrastructure and, specifically, the physical layout of office space. Across four interwoven sections and related appendices, Vaughn assembles her photographs and critical writings alongside xeroxed images, diversity training video stills, and manipulated open source documents of the US Government. The project considers and distills the symptoms of late 20th and 21st century work culture produced by open office plans and modular architecture’s promise of malleability, compliance, and universality — provisions that bid for increased efficiency and productivity at the expense of visibility for Black workers and workers of color. Vaughn looks at how minimalist design gestures of the modern office (as envisioned by Rem Koolhaas’ formative essay Typical Plan, and Herman Miller’s Ethospace brochures) cannot exist outside the conditions of race, class and labor. The project also includes an interview between Vaughn and curator Magdalyn Asimakis, in which the two discuss the structural failings of arts and cultural institutions to practice equitable inclusion of artists of color, or to develop a language and praxis in support of diverse programming that extends beyond compliance, optics, and concerns of the market. Vaughn draws connections between the operations of these institutions to that of the corporate environment, and discusses the ways in which she manipulates their commonalities through the material of her work. In its design, Depreciating Assets intentionally replicates the style, materials, and colors outlined by the US Government Publishing Office—standards set to ensure design efficiency and the economical production of their internal documents. The book draws from the familiar copyshop palette of Venetian blue, tan pink, salmon, green and brown, and uses varied paper stocks in accordance with Paper Standard specifications. In doing so the project takes on and examines the homogeneity imposed by so-called ‘corporate efficiency measures,’ and the fundamental tension between diversity initiatives and one-size-fits-all approaches to office resources. The publication concludes with an afterword by the author contextualizing the project’s themes within the contemporary reality of global pandemic, economic precarity, and protests against racist state violence. Here Vaughn explores how in the absence of an adequate governmental response to structural problems, workplaces implement ad-hoc solutions (such as plexi-dividers) that still leave workers vulnerable and at risk — most acutely, Black workers who are often underinsured.",2021,Jessica Vaughn,,North America,Global North,https://www.printedmatter.org/catalog/57503

Together, they navigate the contours of an evolving and increasingly conspicuous relationship between humankind and the natural world, enriching our understanding of these pivotal intersections.  As the author observes: Our ephemerality, compared to the time of rocks, soils and waters, does not allow us to be able to see, much less witness the liveliness of these things. We do not recognize the holistic continuity of our world, the fact that everything comes from everything, or that everything is connected. So, for us humans, strongly focused on ourselves, the realization that even rocks can die, and that our planet Earth also has a life span, is not something we can easily and naturally accept.

PrivatePrint,The beauty of transience - A statement on anti-artworks,This book skims the artist as not compelled to create—someone who finds herself contemplating existing objects instead of making new ones. This book contains photographic documents of one-off activities and artworks that no longer exist—a story of cleaning the art studio while thinking of anti-art. The action of this book takes place over several days. It is a train of thought expressed through ephemeral and floating words and activities.,2022,Viktorija Poposka,"41.9981, 21.4254",Europe,Global North,https://privateprint.mk/en/books/the-beauty-of-transience-a-statement-on-anti-artworks
PrivatePrint,On the Museum's Ruins,"On the Museum in Ruins by Douglas Crimp, translated by Iva Dimovska, analyzes the end of modernist artistic practice and the significance of the museum within its framework as a comprehensive institution of artistic creation. The significant introduction to this collection of essays, Photographs at the End of Modernism, announces Crimp's further practice in activist art in support of the movement to fight AIDS, that is, outside the institutional treatment of art within the museum, and towards the sphere of art as a social practice. This shift in Crimp's interests is particularly symptomatic of the views on the museum and on art, expressed in this book, which is why, at length, in the introduction, he provides the context of its emergence. It is this context and the photographs taken and selected by Louise Lawler, that shape, within the product of the book itself, the position that the essays present in terms of content - on the museum as an institution whose time has run out.",2022,Douglas Crimp,"41.9981, 21.4254",Europe,Global North,https://privateprint.mk/en/books/za-muzejot-vo-urnatini

The basis on which Jovan connects all the elements in the book and positions his research is – language, or rather the way things are said and how our perception of things changes through linguistic formulations. Thus, the book, consisting of four chapters, takes us through four different variations of reading the subject, even when dealing with purely visual information.

Dushan uses his background in graffiti art when creating his drawings; therefore, these drawings are defined by using rollers, sprays, and brushes. The skull symbol offers multiple meanings anchored in religion, spirituality, or archeology. Still, the book’s concept doesn’t evoke these references but positions the drawing of the human skull as a ubiquitous symbol that corresponds to the contemporary context.",2022,Dushan Stefanovski,"41.9981, 21.4254",Europe,Global North,https://privateprint.mk/en/books/i-would-rather-die-than-be-uncomfortable
PrivatePrint,Prototyping tenderness: a personal log of a dying world,"Prototyping Tenderness: A Personal Log of a Dying World is a research project by the young trans-disciplinary designer Klelija Zhivkovikj. Like in her ongoing practice, the project deals with design’s and designer’s roles in the present world based on the accumulation of products and their disposal, focusing on the opportunities for the future development of that role. In response to today’s anthropocentric and consumeristic world, she offers the concepts of care and tenderness. Man (humanity) is entangled with the entire living and non-living world; that space of touch and contact is what she calls tenderness. She suggests to make tender the social and bodily boundaries and to get out of the anthropocentrism that brings this world to ruin. Klelija sets a post-apocalyptic scenery in this project: today’s world is already dying.

As an artist that primarily uses video as her medium of expression, she uses it as a starting point in the concept of this book. She proposes a possible way of looking at things, which she calls surfacing the middle angle of the vertical and horizontal axis. This aims to destabilize the viewer’s normative perception and orientation. Using various mirrors, screens, and surfaces, shifting horizons, landscapes, and innerscapes, Mirchevska displays a specific visual language and narrative to achieve this goal.

PrivatePrint,15 Horror Stories by Women Workers,"15 Horror Stories by Women Workers by Kristina Bozhurska is an artistic documentary project and is the first publication in the new PrivatePrint’s edition, Emerging Concepts Edition. Primarily, this book is conceived and realized as a fundraising project for support of the disenfranchised labor rights of the women workers in North Macedonia. With every sold book a contribution is made for the activities of the organization Glasen tekstilec from Stip that aim to enable better conditions of the women workers in the textile, leather and shoemaking industries. On the other hand the publishing of the book in English underlines the importance of internationalization of the problem and creates broader space where the voice of these women would echo outside our local context. The book is consisted of 15 testimonies by women workers mostly from the textile and the shoemaking industries, but also from other economic sectors, accompanied by drawings made by the author herself. Bozhurska uses a journalistic approach in the book by collecting authentic statements of the women workers. In this sense, 15 Horror Stories by Women Workers by Kristina Bozhurska becomes a sort of a symbolic pamphlet that disseminates the voices of these women and develops a method for the artistic engagement to gain a new, re-elaborated form and realistically contribute to the issue it thematizes. The activism and the fight on worker’s rights is one of the main and the most important fights for equality and justice towards all citizens everywhere in the world, not only in a historic perspective, but today as well. The voices of the women workers from North Macedonia state problems, injustices, and traumatic experiences that are understandable and pressing at an international level as well. The proposal for this book project was the winner at our first open call (2019) for the Emerging Concepts Edition with a focus at feminist and queer art and critique.",2020,Kristina Bozhurska,"41.9981, 21.4254",Europe,Global North,https://privateprint.mk/en/books/15-horror-stories-by-women-workers

A doorway into the complex (un)weaving of @pantano__’s Honduran family, the territory, and how geopolitical issues cut through those experiences. It explores themes such as legends, oral history, sexual abuse, magic, caves, rock art, and migration through photography, painting, sculpture, drawing, and poetry. Central America is an isthmus located at the convergence of five tectonic plates. This creates pressure, tension, and movement. Honduras is a latent wound. The geological ground of Honduras is excessively porous. This means it is unstable and mutable. One could say that the ground that holds us works like a mirror: it reflects the political, cultural, economic, and emotional instability of those who inhabit it.

Rab-Rab press,"Wanting Something Completely Different: 111 Vignettes of Left-Wing Figures, Themes, Films, and Writers (New Edition)","The second edition of Jairus Banaji’s book Wanting Something Completely Different with new cover design. The book discusses a range of political figures, themes, directors and writers in a series of brief, evocative descriptions (‘vignettes’) aimed at laying out a vision of a modern, cosmopolitan left that can think creatively about the world we live in. The political figures include both thinkers and activists from a wide range of backgrounds — from Frantz Fanon and the Palestinian novelist Ghassan Kanafani to the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya.  The themes range equally widely from the death of Walter Benjamin (reconstructed here from a remarkable documentary on the same theme) and the slaying of Pasolini to the work of British Marxist Perry Anderson, or the corrupt nature of India’s leading corporate groups, or the outstanding contributions of Italian and U.S. Black feminists to feminist theory. And under the rubrics which discuss film and literature, there is the same striving for diversity and depth. Jairus Banaji is a historian who received the Isaac and Tamara Deutscher Memorial Prize in 2011. His academic work has ranged widely across sources and languages, with major books on Late Antiquity and (most recently) commercial capitalism as well as numerous papers and articles. The vignettes collected in this Rab-Rab book reflect the same dazzling versatility and passion for ideas. They were first circulated on Facebook over some seven years or more and are reproduced here with a new introduction and extensive bibliographical references and notes.",2025,Jairus Banaji,"60.1699, 24.9384",Europe,Global North,https://www.rabrab.net/titles/jairus-new
Rab-Rab press,Karl Marx in Karlsbad,"Karl Marx spent three consecutive summers in the spa town of Karlsbad (now Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic) in 1874, 1875 and 1876. Egon Erwin Kisch’s 1946 text Karl Marx in Karlsbad reconstructs these three stays. When Marx arrived in Karlsbad to take the waters for the first time, he was suffering, tired, tense, overworked and overly nervous, in other words, he was burnout. Years of political and theoretical work under agonising hardship and constant oppression had left Marx with pleurisy, inflammation of the lungs, inflammation of the nerves in his head, a carbuncle, a lung abscess and sciatica. Marx’s recovery in Karlsbad, surrounded by princes, ministers, aristocrats, chamber singers, adventurers, spies, and courtesans, is a story full of amusing anecdotes and surprises.  E.E. Kisch, described by Anna Seghers as a detective, investigated this lesser known period of Marx’s life and resolved some mysteries of international importance. For the first time fully translated, the essay is introduced by its editor, Sezgin Boynik, presenting Kisch within the context of interwar leftist avant-garde internationalism. The afterword by Sam Dolbear and Hannah Proctor revisits the emotional life of Marx and his daughter Eleonor during their visits to Karlsbad, without insulating them from the forces of history. Dolbear and Proctor are both writers and researchers, who have previously worked together on an essay on revolutionary childhood, as co-editors of a series of pamphlets on Walter Benjamin’s Arcades Project, and on dreams, sleep, work, puppets, play, and proletarian children’s theatre. Designed by Ott Kagovere, the book features etchings and photographs of Karlsbad from the 19th century, as well as a colour reproduction of Christian Schad’s portrait of Kisch with tattoos.",2025,E.E.

The book is the result of research in the Union’s archives in the Printed Material Collection of the Museum of Yugoslavia in Belgrade. Matrijaršija reconstructs the forgotten history of the leftist graphic and typographic workers by studying the Union’s posters and leaflets, which bear witness to their rich artistic and cultural programme realised between 1920 and 1941. The book offers engaging theoretical discussions on the importance of cultural and artistic (self-)organisation and the significance of solidarity among workers in the printing industry. The members of the Matrijaršija collective bring this history to life in a series of collages, visual poems, plays, and short stories. Optically Suspicious is the first volume in the ‘tehnika’ series, which focuses on the technical aspects of radical publishing practices. The volumes in the series will discuss the ways in which radical and independent publishing practices introduce entirely new forms of printing, typography, design, distribution and content. Edited by Rab-Rab Press, Matrijaršija and Baraba, the aim of the series is to deal with the actuality of the fluid form of revolutionary printing techniques and to develop and connect them with contemporary publishing practices. Conceived, designed and printed by Matrijaršija, Optically Suspicious is entirely manufactured with risporint and is the expanded edition and translation of the first Serbo-Croatian version published in 2022 in collaboration with the Museum of Yugoslavia.

"," In 1925, playwright Berta Lask (1878–1967) wrote a play to mark the 400th anniversary of the German Peasants’ War. In it, she imagines Thomas Müntzer waking up every hundred years to address the contemporary political situation.  To mark the 100th year of the play and the 500th of the Peasants’ War, today, on May Day, we are releasing as a PDF the translation of Berta Lask’s Thomas Müntzer: Dramatic depiction of the German Peasants’ War of 1525.  Translated for the first time into English by Sam Dolbear in collaboration with Esther Leslie, Joey Simons, and Charlotte Thießen, the PDF of the play includes character lists, explanatory notes, and prop lists. It is our hope that readings or performance of the play take place all over the world, to mark the centenary of the play and the quincentenary of the events it depicts.  In the play, Lask poses a basic question: What would Thomas Müntzer see if he woke up today? A list accrues: Climate breakdown, imperialism, gendered oppression, earthquakes, genocide, impending fascism. Capitalism didn’t dig its own grave. Rather, the dead oppressors of previous centuries have been resurrected, planted in new bodies, tooled with new modes of bondage, within uneven spatial domination and temporal disjunction.

Through a reflection on the Oceanocene—conceptualizing exile and the human and non-human condition through the fluidity of flows—and Profane Childhood—a figure that disrupts established categories—the work transforms the screen into a battleground of perception, where the visible is sabotaged to reveal the silent insurrections of the invisibilized and those whom the State seeks to banish. Published on the occasion of Sylvain George’s programme at the ICA, London, 4-6 April 2025, curated by Elizabeth Dexter.

Rab-Rab press,The Decembrists,"The first English translation of Larisa Reisner’s writings on the Decembrist uprising. Written in 1925, a year before her death, for the centenary of the rising, these essays were Reisner’s first works of history, looking back on this turbulent period in Russia with a Marxist understanding of the past. Translated and introduced by Cathy Porter, the Decembrist writings are full of drama and imagination, building a compelling picture of the lives of the young poets, officers and aristocrats of Russia’s first revolution against the tsarist autocracy in 1825.The heroine of the October Revolution, Larisa Reisner was widely considered to be its greatest journalist, read by millions in the new mass-circulation Soviet press, whose writings from the front line of the Civil War, from Afghanistan, Weimar Germany, and the mines and factories of Soviet Ukraine and the Urals became her six important books The Front, Afghanistan, Berlin, October 1923, Hamburg at the Barricades, In Hindenburg's Country, and Coal Iron and Living People. Simultaneously works of art, guides to action, sources of information and knowledge, and unique records of their time and place, these books were written in just under ten years, before her premature death in 1926, aged 31. In the Nazi book burnings of 1933, Hamburg at the Barricades was the first Soviet work to be thrown into the flames, before the works of Lenin, Mayakovsky, Isaac Babel and Maxim Gorky - for pursuing under the guise of historical accuracy an entirely different aim, of giving instructions to the German Communist Party for a civil war. These essays on the Decembrist rising, which Viktor Shklovsky praised as the best things she ever wrote, were her last published works. Deeply researched from material in the Leningrad and Moscow archives available only after the Revolution, Reisner brilliantly captures the Decembrists’ secret criminal brotherhood, bound by class and the fear of discovery, their oaths and initiations, the intensity of their friendships, their allegiances and betrayals. The essays are introduced in detail by translator Cathy Porter who also compiled a bibliography and a dramatis personae of her main characters, most of whom English-speaking readers will be unfamiliar with. Cathy Porter has published over twenty books on Russian history, culture and politics, most recently Larisa Reisner. A Biography (2nd ed., Brill/Historical Materialism/Haymarket, 2022), shortlisted for the Isaac Deutscher Memorial Prize, and its accompanying volume Writings of Larisa Reisner, her six books, translated with Richard Chappell.

Rab-Rab press,ULTRA-RED: A Journal of Militant Sound Inquiry,"For their thirtieth anniversary, Ultra-red, the international sound art and popular education collective is releasing the first volume of ULTRA-RED: A Journal of Militant Sound Inquiry, investigating movement-based listening practices that take the forms of militant inquiry and political education. In the words of Ultra-red, No movement without listening! The initial issue of ULTRA-RED examines conjunctural analysis, or naming the moment, as a practice of collective inquiry. The issue begins with conversations with three popular educators in North America who, in the 1990s, developed a body of literature meant to guide radical groups through an inquiry into what Stuart Hall once called, the history of the present.  It includes a discussion with Toronto-based activist Chris Cavanaugh who participated in numerous conjunctural analysis efforts in political movements across Canada. In 2000, Cavanaugh helped start the Catalyst Project as a center for working-class and leftist education. The next interview features Mary Zerkel, a Chicago-based organizer and artist who produced the seminal text, Coyuntural Analysis: Critical Thinking for Meaningful Action in 1997. Zerkel talks about the relationship between her organizing work in local anti-racist and anti-imperialist struggles as well as her involvement in numerous political art collectives in Chicago.  The journal also features an extended conversation with Gustavo Castro Soto in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico. Castro Soto is known internationally as the last person to have been with Honduran indigenous activist Berta Cáceres when she was assassinated by paramilitaries in 2016. Recently known for his anti-extractivist efforts in Central America, Castro Soto was part of a team in the late 1990s that produced a ten-volume series of booklets guiding people through the history and political praxis of conjunctural analysis, Metodología de Análisis de Coyuntura. The ULTRA-RED journal connects local struggles across contexts, publishing dispatches from ongoing militant investigations in London, Los Angeles, and in prisons in the U.S. South. The journal also introduces reflections on the problems of militant sound inquiry through poetry, book responses, letters, and visual art. The journal is edited by Dont Rhine in collaboration with David Albright and Christina Sanchez Juarez. It includes contributions by Tony Carfello, Janna Graham, Museo de la Palabra y la Imagen, Chris Jones, Karla, Elliot Perkins, Daniela Lieja Quintanar, and Robert Sember. Ultra-red began as a queer techno duo coming out of AIDS activism. Since starting in 1994, Ultra-red has expanded into an international collective rooted in different popular struggles such as anti-racism and anti-gentrification. In the early 2000s, the collective began experimenting with militant sound inquiry synthesizing diverse forms of organized listening in Left and social movements. Designed by Ott Kagovere, the journal has 248 pages and includes over a hundred images in black and white and full colour. It can be ordered either directly from our website or through our distributors.

Rab-Rab press,Biting the Hand: Traces of Resistance in the Art & Language diaspora,"Edited, compiled and introduced by Paul Wood, Biting the Hand: Traces of Resistance in the Art & Language diaspora is about a dissident formation of artists active in the UK in the 1970s and 80s. The book tells the story of artists engaging with a critique of then-contemporary modernist art education, who have embarked on a series of theoretical investigations which became increasingly politicised under the pressures of an evolving social crisis. Increased racism, unemployment and attacks on the organised working class all raised questions about how a critical art might respond. By the late 1970s, these radical artists, mostly in the orbit of the Art & Language group, were producing posters and leaflets for a wide range of left-wing causes, as well as analyses of the politics of art and design education and the role of cultural ideology in maintaining consensus. In the 1980s, as Thatcherism tightened its grip, those involved went their separate ways into areas as diverse as media work, trade unionism, health and education. Biting the Hand has three parts: a retrospective introduction setting the formation in its historical context, and two annotated documentary sections presenting examples of the work as both text and image, written and edited by Paul Wood. It also includes a foreword by Sezgin Boynik, publisher, and an afterword by Ann Stephen, curator and art historian, further expanding on the book's subject.For many years Paul Wood worked for the Art History Department of the Open University. His publications from that period include Conceptual Art (2000), Western Art and the Wider World (2013), and the four-volume anthology Art in Theory (1990-2020), co-edited with Charles Harrison and others.",2024,Paul Wood,"60.1699, 24.9384",Europe,Global North,https://www.rabrab.net/titles/paulwood
Rab-Rab press,The Sugar and the Hunger,"The first English language translation of Robert Linhart’s The Sugar and the Hunger, originally published in 1980 is an indispensable factographic inquiry into modern hunger. Widely acclaimed for his engaged social analyses of proletariat and peasant struggles around the world, Linhart’s inquiry into the sugar regions of North-Eastern Brazil, juxtaposes heterogeneous traits of the impoverished workers’ stories into a vivid cinematic montage. Alongside the translation, the book also includes ‘The Third World, Investigations, Social Analysis’, an unpublished interview with Linhart from 1980 made by Jean Copans, giving an insight into the political and theoretical background of his investigation in Brazil. The afterword by Luiz Renato Martins, an active Brazilian Marxist art historian and journalist, further contextualises the importance of Linhart’s book. Renato Martins who recently directed a documentary film Conversations With Robert Linhart discusses The Sugar and the Hunger against the backdrop of today's world where the practices of expropriation of land and food from peasants and urban poor, which Linhart examined in 1980 on a laboratory-like scale, have now become common global practices, endlessly producing legions of uprooted and hungry refugees.",2024,Robert Linhart,"60.1699, 24.9384",Europe,Global North,https://www.rabrab.net/titles/linhart
Rab-Rab press,111 Vignettes,"Wanting Something Completely Different discusses a range of political figures, themes, directors and writers in a series of brief, evocative descriptions (‘vignettes’) aimed at laying out a vision of a modern, cosmopolitan left that can think creatively about the world we live in. The political figures include both thinkers and activists from a wide range of backgrounds — from Frantz Fanon and the Palestinian novelist Ghassan Kanafani to the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya. The themes range equally widely from the death of Walter Benjamin (reconstructed here from a remarkable documentary on the same theme) and the slaying of Pasolini to the work of British Marxist Perry Anderson, or the corrupt nature of India’s leading corporate groups, or the outstanding contributions of Italian and U.S. Black feminists to feminist theory. And under the rubrics which discuss film and literature, there is the same striving for diversity and depth. Jairus Banaji is a historian who received the Isaac and Tamara Deutscher Memorial Prize in 2011. His academic work has ranged widely across sources and languages, with major books on Late Antiquity and (most recently) commercial capitalism as well as numerous papers and articles. The vignettes collected in this Rab-Rab book reflect the same dazzling versatility and passion for ideas. They were first circulated on Facebook over some seven years or more and are reproduced here with a new introduction and extensive bibliographical references and notes.",2024,Jairus Banaji ,"60.1699, 24.9384",Europe,Global North,https://www.rabrab.net/titles/jairus
Rab-Rab press,Bourgeois with a Heart: The Class Suicide of hjalmar Linder," In 1918 Hjalmar Linder was the richest man in Finland, owning much land and many factories. At the end of World War I, as Germany convulsed in defeat and revolution, Civil War broke out in Finland. Linder’s brother-in-law General Mannerheim advised him to flee to Sweden. When he returned after the conflict, he went looking for his workers in the prison camps. He was shocked by the inhumane conditions they faced, and wrote an article in Hufvudstadsbladet, the main Finnish newspaper in Swedish, with the title Nog Med Blodbad! (Enough with the Bloodbaths) on May 25th 1918. He said the White Terror must end because prisoners were dying like flies. As a result, he was accused of sympathy with Communism, received death threats, and fled abroad. In 1921 Hjalmar Linder committed suicide, penniless in Marseilles, slashing his wrists",2023,Minna Henriksson,"60.1699, 24.9384",Europe,Global North,https://www.rabrab.net/titles/linder
Rab-Rab press,The Marketplace of Art,"The first English translation of Karel Teige’s The Marketplace of Art in two volumes includes a critical introduction, inquiries, and extensive commentaries. Originally published in the Czech language in 1936, The Marketplace of Art is the summation of Teige’s artistic, political, and theoretical work. Acclaimed as one of the leading theoreticians of avant-garde art and architecture between the two world wars, Teige’s more political writings still remain to be discovered. Written in 1936, in the context of the rising conservative right-wing culture, and during the intense debates between the avant-garde artists and the Communist Party, The Marketplace of Art is a response to the capitulation of contemporary art to fascist and Stalinist currents. Teige discusses this reaction as something deeply inscribed into the culture of the bourgeoisie, which he claims is a culture not able to create and inspire any other kind of art besides a hollow and pompous academism or sentimental kitsch. Teige’s Marxist analysis of the art market shows in which way this culture is tied with capitalist institutions and he offers artistic and political strategies to oppose its absolutism. In today’s warmongering culture of authoritarian neoliberalism where the contemporary art market is run by oligarchs, Karel Teige’s radical critique of the art market is more relevant than ever.  We present this long-awaited translation with an accompanying volume of commentaries and interventions. Edited and introduced by Sezgin Boynik and Joseph Grim Feinberg, the book is published in collaboration with Contradictions/Kontradikce Journal based in Prague. The commentary volume includes commissioned essays by Zbyněk Baladrán, Dave Beech, Jana Ndiaye Berankova, Michel Chevalier, Esther Leslie, John Roberts, and Paul Wood, as well as an inquiry on The Marketplace of Art with responses from František Dryje, Tomáš Hříbek, Rea Michalová, Šimon Svěrák, and Roman Telerovský.

Rab-Rab press,Punk Research Series Volume 1: Punk Suprematism,"Punk Suprematism includes the first English translation of theoretical writings on punk, art, socialism, bureaucracy, and nationalism by Slavoj Žižek, Rastko Močnik, and Zoja Skušek. Written in the first half of the eighties, these texts are a unique mixture of punk attitude with theoretical concepts borrowed from Althusser, Lacan, and avant-garde art. Written in a turbulent period of Yugoslav socialism, these texts were trying to understand the political importance of punk as a mass movement of impoverished youth. The conclusions of these interventions had a lasting effect on the theoretical formation of Yugoslav post-Marxism, as well to the organizational forms of the socialist alternative. The book also includes a foreword on the historical context of the eighties and the extensive narrative bibliography of punk related publications in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia written by Sezgin Boynik. In addition to this, it also includes translations of the two editorials to Punk Problemi written by renowned Slovenian theoreticians.  The book designed by Ott Kagovere is published in December 2021.Punk Suprematism is the first volume of the Punk Research Series. The series starts from the idea that punk is a break, and it will focus on punk as something completely separated from bourgeois culture. We see punk as a radical gesture within youth mass culture with the most precise, immediate, and declarative expression. Our working hypothesis is that punk is an expression and form, combining learning with negation, dialectics with refusal, violence with egalitarianism, negativity with community, and fierceness with collectivity. This attitude has reshaped everything in our culture, including concepts within theory, structures of organisation, and forms of experimental art. With the series we will detect this punk effect, particularly focusing on its internationalist and explicitly political iterations. Punk Research Series will continue with publications about The Pop Group concert in Helsinki in 1980 organised by the Communist Party of Finland; a complete annotated bibliography of punk and underground fanzines published in Turkey from the beginning of the eighties; analysis of the global impact of Finnish hard-core punk syntax; and studies on punk education, the non-repressive vituperative language of punk poetry, proletarian queer narratives, the images of class struggles in hard-core punk, and the definition of punk-jazz.",2021,"Slavoj Žižek, Rastko Močnik, Zoja Skušek, Sezgin Boynik

Rab-Rab press,Fake Star,"In March 1899, a fireball flew over Helsinki, and for a while it was thought that the end of the world had come. The meteorite hit the ice in Bjurböle Bay in Porvoo. The newspapers wrote that the meteorite was a message sent from the civilised West, portending liberation of the country from Russian rule. The interpretation was based on the ancient Swedish word for beaver, bjur (bobr in Russian). Speculation was fuelled by the name of the site of impact, Bjurböle (Bobrikovo in Russian), and it was inferred that the nearby villa of the Russian Governor-General Bobrikov must have been the intended target of the meteorite. Once the meteorite was lifted from the bottom of the sea, a plaster copy was made of it, which was presented at the crucial appearance in the country’s history, the 1900 Paris World’s Fair. The copy was placed on display in the heart of the Finnish Pavilion, surrounded by achievements of Finnish art, industry, education and science. The idea was to convince the rest of the world that Finland was indeed one of the civilised nations of the West. The book is an outcome of an artistic investigation into the relation of the copy and original in the context of construction of the nation in Finland and the colonialist logic of the World Fairs. It is a story, aimed at children and adults alike that narrates the encounter of King Oscar II of Sweden and the Russian representative at the pavilion of Finland, Prince Tenisheff.

Rab-Rab press,"Rab-Rab: journal of political and formal inquiries in art, #6","Beginning with this issue, we plan to use the journal as a platform to support, gather, discuss, and propagate the experiences of people who want to organize against capitalism, nationalism, chauvinism, and all other kinds of reactionary ideologies. There are testimonies, interviews, statements, theses and studies – as in all previous issues – but from now on, politics will outweigh form. Here, we publish two interviews with musicians discussing their experiences with organizing. Milena Solomun talks about her punk formation, which took place during a bloody civil war and alongside the destruction of socialism in Yugoslavia. Ben Watson and Jair-Rohm Parker Wells’ long discussion on Musical Dialectics is also about punk, precisely Punk Jazz and Free Improvisation, and the way musical decisions have wider political resonance, including clear-cut ideological demarcations. Their collective is called AMM All-Stars (from the Association of Musical Marxists). Kaisa Lassinaro looks at a library collection of feminist and lesbian literature, and asks what it means to read these materials with explicit political and Marxist references? Ghassan Halwani gives a condensed summary of a long and ongoing activist interaction with archives through the defamiliarization of memoirs from the Civil War in Lebanon; beyond the ideologies of liberal reconciliation. From this issue, Rab-Rab journal initiates a research project dedicated to studying laws of uneven and combined development in contemporary art. The transcript of two interviews from Doruntina Kastrati’s film is a case in point. Kastrati’s film about workers who were seriously injured and, in some cases, died while working for a one euro hourly pay rate on the highway in Kosovo for the most powerful companies, can be understood through the laws of uneven and combined development. The long theoretical article by Rastko Močnik on the ideologies of contemporary art, that we are proud to publish here, especially addresses these forms. Močnik’s real target is the prevalence of reactionary and conservative ideas in contemporary art practices which, historically, were established by relativizing the revolutions of avant-garde art.  Following this, we initiate a rubric called ‘General Rhythm.’ By understanding form as a sedimented content, we propose a method of objective form that will enable us to discern the general rhythms of society beneath the cacophony of capitalist unevenness and contradiction. We apply this approach modestly to a few local examples in Finland (Mika Vainio exhibition, Sorbus gallery publication, Veijo Rönkkönen sculptures, Edvard Richter award) and are satisfied with the results. In the following issues, this will be developed into a full-scale research project in collaboration with theoreticians, activists, artists and curators from all around the world. As a supplement to this issue, we are publishing the first English translation of Walter Benjamin’s text on Lenin, actually Benjamin’s review of Lenin’s letters to Maxim Gorky, originally from 1926. Translated by Esther Leslie, who also annotated the text, Benjamin’s review portrays a different Lenin, one whose personal life is not detached from his revolutionary politics; the Lenin of subjective politics.",2021,Sezgin Boynik,"60.1699, 24.9384",Europe,Global North,https://www.rabrab.net/titles/rabrab6

The document is a transcribed conversation between Mao Zedong and the Central Group for the Cultural Revolution with the five most famous Red Guards leaders, which took place on 28th June 1968 at Beijing University. This unique historical document is presented with detailed annotations by the translator of the text Andrea Piazzaroli Longobardi, who has given historical insight into the complex relations within the Cultural Revolution. Both the foreword and afterword to the document are written by Alessandro Russo, a theoretician and sinologist, whose work on the Cultural Revolution has given a fresh philosophical perspective for grasping the subjective dimension of this antagonistic episode in modern politics. By discussing the document as a ‘script’ for a stage performance, Russo claims that the artistic approaches, rather than the supposed classical socio-historical scholarly wisdom, are better qualified to look at the document as deeply subjective, that is, as intrinsically political. Rab-Rab Press is pleased to present this theatrical and political document as evidence of the fact that real learning happens in the scenes of antagonisms and contradictions, violating the limits of liberal equilibrium. By collecting bits and pieces of subjective traces from this divisive and confrontational historical period, we discover that it also included plenty of humour, irony, elan, youthfulness, and brightness. Ultimately, we hope this book will give a clue to the idea of what Mao actually meant when he asked professional writers and students to write a novel per week.",2020,https://www.rabrab.net/titles/mao,"60.1699, 24.9384",Europe,Global North,

As a break from the idealist philosophy, Marx’s writings on thefts of wood is considered to be a turning point in the history of communist theory. In his text, Rancière does not only discuss the complex structure of Marx’s early concepts, but he does this by such ‘wild formalism’ that opens the communist horizon towards unfamiliar realms. Defending this approach still today, Rancière in the new introduction written to the book gives also some clues about his difficult relationship with Althusser.

Radical theory and praxis,The Future Revolution: Popular Assemblies and the Prospect of Direct Democracy,"Murray Bookchin is an American social theorist, political and social philosopher, and the founder of social ecology, who devoted his life to developing a new type of left politics. The book The Future Revolution consists of nine short essays in which Bookchin discusses the current problems of the modern revolutionary movement, criticizes the failures of past movements for social change and in broad strokes outlines the contours of a free society of the future. Bookchin shows the fallacy of Marx's predictions and considers the class approach too narrow for understanding modernity and mobilizing the broad masses. He sees a great mobilizing force in the problems of environmental destruction, the quality of living space and participation in community life. Bookchin consistently constructs a critique of the state and parliamentary democracy, proposing instead a confederalist alternative based on a network of decision-making popular assemblies that delegate recallable deputies to solve problems at different levels. Bookchin's communalist project sets the principles for the future society: a municipal economy in place of the capitalist one, social ecology, and the widest possible use of direct democracy through popular assemblies united in confederations.",2023,Murray Bookchin,"55.7569, 37.6151",Europe,Global North,https://www.rtpbooks.info/product/budushhaja-revoljucija-narodnye-assamblei-i-perspektiva-prjamoj-demokratii-mjurrej-bukchin/
Radical theory and praxis,Journey through places of deprivation,"Ivan Astashin is a political prisoner, a defendant in the first in a long chain of cases invented by the special services, classified under the article on terrorism. In 2009, Ivan and his comrades took part in an action against the FSB on Chekist Day - an arson attack on the FSB department for the South-West District of Moscow. By court order, Ivan served 9 years and 9 months in prison - most of the term in maximum security camps in Krasnoyarsk Krai. The Journey is the most important document of the era, testifying to the contemporary Russian prison reality, which in many ways serves as a manifestation of the repressive structure of life in Russia. Ivan looks closely and attentively in a research-like manner, records the facts of prison life, describes the diversity of forms of existence in prison in the most diverse living conditions, which he had the opportunity to observe and feel personally. Much of the book's text speaks of the constantly reproducing violence in prison, which permeates all levels of the penal system's work. And yet, behind all the horrors of prison life, Ivan's text highlights a powerful life-affirming message: words about brotherhood and mutual assistance, solidarity between prisoners and possible resistance to violence, the ability to find joy in simple things and to be free, at least for a short time, in the unfree prison world.",2022,Ivan Astashin,"55.7569, 37.6151",Europe,Global North,https://www.rtpbooks.info/product/puteshestvie-po-mestam-lishenija-ivan-astashin/

","The book examines the problem of power and consistently establishes the universal procedure that underlies it and allows it to be noticed in the most diverse contexts.

Events of socio-political history and its artistic reflection in cinema, prose and poetry, medieval theology and protest movements, religious sectarianism and gender theory, counterculture and decolonial perspective, the existential status of animals and the trajectory of scientific and technological progress - all this makes up the horizon in which the philosophical concept of the book Power and the Body is built.

Tell an animal rights activist that awarding prizes to the most humane slaughterhouses simply prolongs animal suffering, and you'll get a ton of arguments against it. The book exposes the many intersections of human and animal oppression in the light of capitalist exploitation. The author examines animal rights not only from an ethical perspective, but also through the prism of the nature of labor and commodity relations, and analyzes the concepts of oppression, power, and hierarchy at all levels.

Radical theory and praxis,Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"Pedagogy of the Oppressed by the outstanding Brazilian educator and revolutionary Paulo Freire was written back in 1968 and had a significant impact on the development of modern education. Since then, about a million copies have been sold worldwide in different languages. Unfortunately, Freire's ideas have not been known to the domestic reader until now, so practices such as banking education, which he criticizes, remain standard in our schools and universities to this day. However, the proposed book will be interesting not only and not so much to teachers as to radical activists, because, according to Freire, a real revolution is always a cultural and pedagogical activity, is always a dialogue, an act of love. The author raises questions about the correspondence of means to the goal, about the relationship between freedom and authority, and about much more. Written at a certain historical moment, this book, despite the apparent naivety of some of the statements contained in it, continues to inspire and remind the new generation of revolutionaries of the most important thing for which we fight and suffer.",2019,Paulo Freire,"55.7569, 37.6151",Europe,Global North,https://www.rtpbooks.info/product/pedagogika-ugnetennyh-paulu-frejre/

This is reminiscent of the best impulses of the anarchists during the Spanish Civil War or the cooperatives after the Russian Revolution, when people built their lives in a new way. As part of their field research, the authors studied how new ideas are being synthesized with traditions in Kurdistan using specific examples – schools, volunteer battalions, district councils.

Radical theory and praxis,Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology,"The author invites readers to become acquainted with a discipline that currently exists only in its infancy – anarchist anthropology. He proves that we have much to learn from so-called primitive communities that live without a state and external coercion, and debunks the widespread myth of progressive European empires – winners on the treadmill of enlightenment and technological development (but in fact, successful in war). At the same time, the author is critical of primitivism and argues that horizontal societies can exist at the current level of civilization. In addition to Fragments, the book includes Graeber’s articles from different years, in which he raises the following questions: why does the idea of ​​any radical transformation of society increasingly seem unrealistic to us, and if it is no longer possible to change the socio-political system by storming the Bastille, what should we do to bring the revolution closer? How does structural violence affect our imagination and identification with others? What role do debt obligations play in world history, and what has changed in 5,000 years? David Graeber is an American anarchist, professor of anthropology, and lecturer at the London School of Economics. Graeber bases his theoretical works on his personal experience as an activist and researcher. He spent several years in Madagascar, researching local tribes and describing their organization in detail.

The authors consider common problems in collective decision-making, offer possible options for eliminating them, give practical advice on increasing the effectiveness of meetings, including virtual ones, and describe in detail the model of a representative council and the process of rapid consensus. Given that many important decisions in the modern world are made regardless of our opinion, the last chapter of the book is especially interesting, devoted to how society can be restructured in such a way as to ensure the fullest possible participation of every inhabitant of the planet in making collective decisions and implementing them.

Radical theory and praxis,How Nonviolence Protects the State,"In his new book, Peter Gelderloos describes the history of social protest on the planet, tells about the attempts of states to subjugate and suppress activists at the moment when they were especially close to victory, debunks the myth about the possibility of only peaceful, non-violent social struggle. Using examples of India’s liberation from colonial oppression, the struggle of American Indians, the struggle for civil rights in the USA, environmental activism and anti-war campaigns, the author shows in detail and very accurately the methods used by supporters of the doctrine of non-violence to extinguish the potential of protests. By arguing that nonviolence is ineffective, patriarchal, deceptive and racist, Gelderloos suggests using a variety of tactics rather than limiting the methods of struggle to pickets and signature collections. Especially now, after the disappearance of the deceived voters movement and numerous failures of local protests, this book is worth reading for everyone who took to the streets of Russian cities and protested in the 2000s and early 2010s.",2014,Peter Gelderloos,"55.7569, 37.6151",Europe,Global North,https://www.rtpbooks.info/product/kak-nenasilie-zashhishhaet-gosudarstvo-p/

Radical theory and praxis,Anarchy Works,"Peter Gelderloos has undertaken an extremely necessary and noble task: to collect from all eras and ends of the world grains of living anarchist experience in the past and present and to present them to the reader - not as a museum exhibit, a beautiful fairy tale of bygone times or a lofty dream, but as an embodied utopia of a free society, an emancipated personality and a libertarian culture. Along the way, he debunks the most widespread and dense myths about anarchy that exist and are replicated today. In his book, anarchy is presented not as a country of milk and honey or as a world of criminal lawlessness of dark villains, but as a completely feasible and already being implemented here and there model of social structure, moral principles, human relationships - with its complexities, imperfections and unpredictability, which only emphasize the feasibility of this eternal dream of a freer, fairer and more humane society.",2012,Peter Gelderloos,"55.7569, 37.6151",Europe,Global North,https://www.rtpbooks.info/product/anarhija-rabotaet-piter-gelderloos/

In the months following this announcement, over a 100 people died as a consequence. As a society we quickly memorialise the consequences of human conflict, natural disasters, and even of random acts of violence, but financial collapses and its human toll are often ignored or rendered invisible.

Reliable Copy,at the kitchen table,"Approaching curatorial practice from the perspective of publishing, at the kitchen table looks at how food has historically been — and continues to be — inscribed through various conventional formats, as well as the channels and platforms by which it continues to circulate as material, trace, memory, and culture. Imagined as a show of documents, the exhibition brings together a selection of cookbooks, video works, and artworks. The selection of cookbooks feature recipes and narratives compiled from artists and art-spaces, anthologies of recipes from literary fiction, cookbooks that function as historical records, and some that are self-published by individuals or community groups. The video works highlight and examine the well-worn format of the instructional cooking class and its associated performativity. Meanwhile, the artworks, which are presented via peripheral, referential, or stand-in documents, respond to (and often assume) the forms of the marketed consumable product, the stand-alone restaurant, the family archive, the recipe book, the menu, the assembly, and the feast. The proposal, the script, the poster, the photographic documentation, the resource list, the newsletter, the Keynote presentation, and the audio recording — elements that are traditionally left out of the work’s exhibition display, but that are often included in catalogues, monographs, or other publications around the work — become stand-ins for the artworks conceptually on display. Through this introduction of artworks via the documents that surround, engender, and represent them, the exhibition seeks to collapse the space between the exhibition and its documentation, the library and the gallery, and the event and its eventual publication. at the kitchen table is a travelling exhibition curated by Reliable Copy that expands through responses to the contexts, sites, and venues of its various iterations, including that of an eventual publication.

During their idiosyncratic philosophical debates, the project employees gradually begin to sense a manic sensorium operating beneath their seemingly sterile financial and logistical systems. Troubles erupt while discussing works of art; futurist imaginaries of financialisation stumble upon the deep inertia of historical time preserved in museums and tombs. Monumental works of art pleasantly rotting in history enter into messy partnerships with volcanoes, hadopelagic planktons, and whimsical vibes of rich people.

Bringing together a selection of essays, an interview, and an artwork which explore the development of this framework, this book touches upon four decades of Robbins’ engagement with the idea of High Entertainment—starting from the 1980s, through its moment of clearest resolution with the advent of digital technology, all the way to the present.",2024,David Robbins,"12.9629, 77.5775",South Asia,Global South,https://reliablecopy.org/High-Entertainment

Rim Books,An Invisible Hand,"An Invisible Hand is Stephen Roucher’s first artist’s book, from his street photographs made between 2012 and 2022. In an era where modern technology offers precise navigation and ubiquitous ‘street-view’ convenience, locations are catalogued and made explicit through GPS coordinates and addresses. Commerce and progress drive these technologies, shaping our environment and perceptions of it. Roucher invites us to consider a machine-driven perspective from another era with his black-and-white photographs made using a view camera, a cutting-edge technology of the 19th century that radically reshaped our perceptions of the world. He captures the urban landscape not with the precision of contemporary tools but with an eye for the timeless and the unseen. The photographs delve into the nuances of public spaces, the rejuvenation of forgotten corners, and the artifacts of once-daily technologies now obsolete. Roucher juxtaposes the meticulously catalogued present with a more ambiguous, reflective view. The book brings to life locations vaguely referenced, ideas repurposed, and the subtle transformations of environments in constant flux. These photographs serve as a testament to the invisible hand guiding our perceptions and interactions with the world. Stephen Roucher is an independent photographer, based in Wellington Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Since graduating from Elam School of Fine Arts in 1995, he has accumulated an archive of conceptually focused series of photographs, depicting the urban and rural environments. His practical experience in the process of photography, both analogue and digital, informs his approach to making his art. He had solo exhibition ‘Stands’ (series of stands mostly from rural sports fields) at Whangarei Art Museum in 2011 and McNamara Gallery, Whanganui in 2012, ‘Void’, an installation in the iconic TestStrip gallery in Auckland in 1995. His photographs were featured in many group shows – including in Now & Then: Enduring and developing themes in contemporary New Zealand photography, Te Manawa, Palmerston North, in 2012.

Rim Books,In Some Smothering Dreams,"What can photographs say about the unimaginable? in some smothering dreams takes our gaze to the First World War, where official photographer Henry Armytage Sanders created the most extensive visual record of New Zealanders on the Western Front. But rather than being an archive of slaughter, Sanders’ photographs often depict the faces of men behind the lines and the landscapes left in the war’s wake. Using details from the original glass plate negatives, Camus Wyatt reimagines these photographs as places of strange beauty, capturing both a profound quiet and a looming sense of dread. With an essay by Deidra Sullivan on the history of the Sanders collection and the possible meanings of their reimagining, in some smothering dreams is a moving contemplation of the pathways between image, archive, the lives of others, and the limits of our understanding. (Sanders’) photographs are deeply evocative of New Zealand’s involvement in this global conflict and of the experience of those who served. The significance of the collection is illustrated by its inclusion on UNESCO’s Memory of the World register. Public engagement with these photographs has always been strong, but by revisiting the original negatives and drawing attention to the quiet detail captured within them, this publication will present a reinterpretation that is sure to deepen both personal and collective connections with these images.—Natalie Marshall, former Curator of Photographs at the Alexander Turnbull Library",2024,"Camus Wyatt, Deidra Sullivan","-36.8509, 174.7645",Oceania,Global North,https://www.rimbooks.com/wordpress/in-some-smothering-dreams
Rim Books,Thread Between Darkness and Light,"Thread Between Darkness and Light, a new photo book by artist Stella Brennan, began with the gift of a painting: a depiction of Rangitoto with a mysterious ruin in the foreground. Investigating its painter led Brennan to an 1897 photograph of her great-great-aunt Louise Laurent with her female classmates – students at the same art school Brennan attended a century later. Struck by this uncanny affinity with her previously unknown ancestor, Brennan embarked on a journey of research and revelation. Cold-calling long-lost relatives, she unearthed an archive of Edwardian glass plate negatives, which a cousin had carefully preserved since Louise’s death in the 1960s. Despite being cracked and marred by mould and dirt, Brennan meticulously scanned the 300 fragile plates. Her first realisation of Louise Laurent and her husband William Winn’s 100 year-old archive was an immersive installation of 36 translucent silk banners, displayed in 2023 at Te Whare Toi, City Gallery Wellington. This book delves deeper into these historical images, juxtaposing the passage of time with startlingly contemporary framings and content. There is even a string-assisted selfie of Louise and William together. On the other hand, the extreme damage sustained by some of the negatives, the cracked glass, peeling emulsion and blooms of mould speak to the time between then and now.  It is this tension that animates the project – this superimposition of time and place. An evocative collaborative essay enlarges the historical and material context. Susan Ballard, Professor of Art History at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington, Kirsty Baker, Curator at Te Whare Toi, and Lissa Mitchell, Curator of Historical Photography at Te Papa, bring their unique perspectives to a text that breathes life into these spectral images. Brennan’s documentation of her discovery process is complemented by historian Ross Galbreath’s riveting account of Louise’s adventurous mother Lucie, tracing her journey from birth in a London workhouse, to the 1871 Siege of Paris, to her arrival with her three daughters in 19th-century Tāmaki Makaurau/ Auckland, Aotearoa/New Zealand.

Rim Books,A Garden is a Long Time,"The photographs in A garden is a long time take us beyond the perimeter of the Central Otago garden where they were created. Incorporating processes and materials from the darker, more mysterious corners of early photographic history, the images offer an account of the life and sensibility of a remarkable artist, Annemarie Hope-Cross (1968–2022). With Jenny Bornholdt’s poetry and prose treading deftly around the edges of Annemarie’s life and photographic work, A garden is a long time is a meditation on time, light and the spaces we all inhabit. For Annemarie Hope-Cross, photography was, at once, a science and a miracle; the camera was an echo chamber and each photograph was a place where past and present met, where the living communed with those lost along the way, and where the most ordinary plants and objects were rendered mysterious, at times radiant. These photographic exposures, and the words that accompany them, are the heartfelt measure of an hour, a day, a season, a lifetime.

Rim Books,Jellicoe & Bledisloe,"When David Cook moved to Hamilton East, he was drawn to the colourful and creative lives of his neighbours. With camera in hand, he explored everything from front-yard mechanics to Sunday roasts, creating an intimate documentary of a State Housing suburb in the 1990s, moments before gentrification set in. In this energetic photobook, we look back twenty-five years to see burgeoning issues of relevance today: housing, bi-cultural relations, social welfare, and freshwater quality, all brought to us through the lens of daily life. The title, Jellicoe & Bledisloe, is a reference to the local street names, commemorating New Zealand Governors General from the early twentieth century. Reflecting on this colonial heritage, Cook writes an engaging first-person account of the suburb, featuring a conversation with Ngaati Wairere historian Wiremu Puke. Together they unearth suppressed histories and rewrite our understanding of the Waikato landscape. Te Papa Tongarewa holds a significant collection of photographs from this series.

Rim Books,Motutapu,"Presented as an exhibition at Te Uru and as this publication, MOTUTAPU is the conclusion of a four-year journey by artist Benjamin Work and photographer Brendan Kitto. This project looks at the shared history of Motutapu (sacred island) throughout Moana Oceania – including Tongatapu, Rarotonga and at the entrance to the Waitematā Harbour here in Tāmaki Makaurau. Motutapu is a place of sanctuary. Positioned at the entrance of great harbours, straddling the open ocean and the mainland, it serves as a gateway for navigators arriving and departing on voyages. The lifting of tapu and making things noa took place on Motutapu, allowing navigators to continue with their journey back to their closest kāinga, even if it was generations later. Work and Kitto’s inquiry into Motutapu was initially centred around the shared name. What soon became apparent was a deeper connection to their own hohoko/ʻakapapa (genealogy) as they travelled to three of the Motutapu locations and connected with key knowledge holders. Motutapu has become a metaphor for Work and Kitto as a starting point for these personal journeys. Through Work’s paintings and Kitto’s photographs of their journeys, combined with the introductions to the three Motutapu locations by Pita Turei, Paul Johansson and Stan Wolfgramm the book offers, for the extended diaspora of Moana Oceania, a way for reconnection and reconciliation and as a reminder of what joins communities across time and space. Motutapu reminds me of the Tongan practice of Tauhi vā (to nurture or maintain relational space), as a metaphor of this sacred in-between space, an island straddled between the deep moana and the fonua of the mainland . . .

Rim Books,Road People of Aotearoa: Images of house-truck journeys 1978-1984,"A historic photo-essay by the late Paul C. Gilbert, this book chronicles the early days of the New Zealand phenomenon of DIY house trucks, which appeared on the roads around the mid-1970s as part of an alternative lifestyle movement. The house-truckers were drawn to the alternative life and music festivals of the time, including Nambassa in the late 1970s and Sweetwaters festivals in the early 1980s. Paul Gilbert travelled with the grass-roots music and performance troupes in their convoys of hand-converted house trucks starting with ‘The Original Travelling Road Show and Mahana’, as they journeyed through small communities and music festivals around the North Island. Paul Gilbert’s camera intimately observes the road people while building and decorating the house trucks with their wonderful interiors and also in their everyday activities. He captures their children and families and the fringe circus and musical performances in various festivals and different locations. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, many house truck conventions and grass-roots festivals around a variety of themes were held in New Zealand where house-truckers would converge, not only for the event but for the opportunity to connect and share information with other truckers. Low-key festival circuits could be found in regions of Coromandel, Northland, and West Auckland, where, for two decades, Moller’s farm at Oratia west of Auckland, a popular venue for blues and folk festivals, offered an open house for truckers to park on a semi-permanent basis as needed. These were unique times indeed. Paul C Gilbert (1954-2019) started taking photographs as a young boy via family influences. Early projects were developed as documentary street photography in the fine arts tradition when he was a founder member of PhotoForum NZ in 1973. He was employed as a photographer at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and then at the Auckland City Art Gallery in the 1970s. He left employment to pursue the project, ‘Road People of Aotearoa’ in 1978. Later, as an independent photographer, he mainly specialised in documenting maritime heritage, vessels and history. He was the technical instructor of photography at Elam School of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland from 1990 to 2008. Haru Sameshima, in his essay, interviews many of the house truckers – to uncover the historical context of the musicians and street performers against the backdrop of the latter stages of the alternative life movement that manifested in the festivals and events in Paul’s photo-essay. The musicians, clowns, street performers, and their friends, who have now seen many of Paul’s photographs for the first time after 40 years, recount the festivals and road journeys in their own words. John B Turner, influential photography teacher at Elam School of Fine Arts from 1971 to 2011 – in his essay reflects upon Paul’s life as an individual and a photographer – and situates his image-making in the international movement of personal documentary photography, as an embedded observer of life, rather than outsider reporter/photojournalist.",2021,Paul C Gilbert,"-36.8509, 174.7645",Oceania,Global North,https://www.rimbooks.com/wordpress/road-people-of-aotearoa-images-of-house-truck-journeys-1978-1984
Rim Books,Carbon Empire,"Carbon Empire works in the space between art and documentary photography. It combines a short series of staged photographs of a ‘man in the street’ made in 1997 with images of closed petrol stations photographed between 2003 and 2017. Carbon Empire is a juxtaposition of these two series of photographs and a single image, made by chance in 2002. The closed petrol stations reflect the effects of petroleum law changes across New Zealand. In 1988, the petroleum sector became deregulated, with the large international wholesalers able to control pricing at both refinery and pump. The small independent retailers (often family run businesses) found it increasingly difficult to survive in an environment too easily manipulated by economies of scale and the politics of supply.

Rim Books,...and then there were none,"A collaborative book by four New Zealand-based photographers and one writer, breaks out of conventional story-telling to play out their anxieties and doubts about the world they see. Developed over the last two years with regular meetings indulgent in wine and homemade cheese as excuses for friendship and banter, ...and then there were none grew from conversations and arguments about mortality, our technologically mired existence and the degradation of the environment. The project triggered its own version of flygskam for the collaborators, conflicted by the international travel that made many of the photographs and the writing possible and tainted by knowing the greater price to be paid. Images included from such travels are drenched in sordid human histories that recall the myriad pathways that have led us to now, and to what comes next. The nod to mortality echoing through the book is rendered stark by the recent death of one of us, adding a sense of urgency to the title of the book – not just for the remaining collaborators, but for us all.",2020,"Harvey Benge, Jon Carapiet, Lloyd Jones, Haru Sameshima, Stu Sontier","-36.8509, 174.7645",Oceania,Global North,
Rim Books,RIVER-ROAD: Journeys Through Ecology,"River/Road takes an intimate look at the environmental, cultural, historical and economic factors that shape the ecology of our immediate environment. The narrative explores regional ecology from a bicultural perspective. The authors trace a journey, following the parallel arteries of the Waikato River and River Road. The emphasis is on being ‘readers’ of the landscape. The authors bring a number of distinct voices to the project. Jonty Valentine the graphic designer, provokes and navigates the reader through a multi-layered account of space and time. Wiremu Puke launches his story-telling journey from the slopes of Taupiri where he surveys the landscape and makes his way upriver through Ngaruawahia and on to the city of Hamilton. He writes about the creatures and people who inhabit the space; wildlife, Tainui history, colonial settlement, contemporary dilemmas and imagined futures. David Cook takes a photographic journey from his hometown of Hamilton, through suburbia, industrial zones, wild spaces, farms and on to Ngaruawahia, under the gaze of Taupiri. His images explore signs of the ever changing ecology of these spaces. Readership: This book will be engaging and readable for a broad audience (high school age and older) – it is not aimed primarily at an elitist academic audience, although it will have potential for academic review and scrutiny. Potential readers are people interested in history, ecology, photography, regional identity. The book will be sold within regional book shops, online, and in some national bookshops that specialise in art books, photography books and environmental books.",2011,"David Cook, Wiremu Puke, Jonty Valentine","-36.8509, 174.7645",Oceania,Global North,https://www.rimbooks.com/wordpress/river-road
Rim Books,A Spoonful of Sugar,"Photographs, texture, historical documents and a fictional short story weave a book about a house, in the suburb of Wilton in Wellington, New Zealand. I moved in to this house amid stories about its commissioner, a trail-blazing woman and the one responsible for bringing the woodwind instrument, the recorder, to New Zealand. The narrative of her and her architect’s lives struck me as still critical and relevant today as we pull down the metaphorical garage door on refugee access to New Zealand and as we uncover and foreground the unnoticed roles women played in society. I wanted to activate the history of this house and its protagonists and bring many of these threads into a book. In 1957 Nancy Martin staked out a humble claim to fame: she was purportedly the first single woman in Wellington to receive a mortgage to build her own home. Martin didn’t have a husband, and is listed on her mortgage as a spinster, a decrepit word that it must have taken more than a spoonful of sugar to get down. Armed with the independence, privacy and self-determination that her own home would allow, Martin claimed an autonomous space for her single and alternatively constituted feminine self, her home was critical to this end. It wasn’t a typical New Zealand home either – Martin commissioned Jewish emigré architect Fredrick Ost to design her whare. It was 1957, seventeen years after Ost’s escape from Europe and this house remains one of a handful of examples of a domestic home designed by him. Ost, originally from Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia) had fled Europe with his young wife, escaping the Nazis and the ‘breach of civilization’ that was to ensue across the landscape of Europe and in Hitler’s concentration camps. As art historian Leonard Bell states, Ost was also an graphic artist and a painter, a radical in his own right, he assembled selections of writing by Jewish poets, wrote an anti-Fascist ballad, essays and poetry. He continued to publish in Europe until his death. Dipping into and out of these narratives this project seeks to invoke the ghosts of change and of futures – of feminism, of modernism, of a haunted house, a musical house, a diasporic house, a Jewish house, and a house from Aotearoa, thereby making visible and audible links between banking history, gender politics, agency and the role of a woman in architecture in Aotearoa.",2015,"Ann Shelton, Pip Adam","-36.8509, 174.7645",Oceania,Global North,https://www.rimbooks.com/wordpress/a-spoonful-of-sugar
Rim Books,Holland Street,"Taking as its starting point two nineteenth-century events – London’s cholera outbreak of 1854 and Wellington’s typhoid epidemic of 1890-2 – Holland Street recalls a world where disease was thought to travel through miasma (noxious air) and bacteria were believed to be as real as Hydras, and Gorgons, and Chimeras Dire. Holland Street utilises differing visual approaches to map critical sites related to these two disease events, one marking the birth of modern epidemiology, and another resulting in the construction of Wellington’s current sewerage system. In telling this story, Holland Street places the spectre of human waste at center stage. The work addresses the cultural, ideological and medical contexts and consequences of an epidemic that took place in the environs of Courtney Place Park. In imposing a visual interruption of the streetscape, Holland Street encourages us to envisage an otherwise invisible conceptual and material infrastructure, tracing its roots back to the nineteenth-century and forward to the present.",2013,"Sarah Caylor, Ann Shelton","-36.8509, 174.7645",Oceania,Global North,https://www.rimbooks.com/wordpress/holland-street

The series also examines themes of home, mobility and financial instability, questioning how modern friendships are formed, expanded or discarded, and what kinds of social or financial contracts emerge during times of transition.

The publication highlights how they challenge the ideologies that hold land hostage to zero-sum prophecies and violently transform maps into multilayered projections of historical violence.

Smog Press,Democratic Vistas,"Democratic Vistas is a collaborative monograph that chronicles unpublished work from Tim Carpenter and Jason Lee from 2008 - 2019. The project is inspired by Walt Whitman’s 1871 book of the same title, in which Whitman’s visionary lyrical prose confronts post-Civil War America and beckons its soul. Lee and Carpenter fostered a kinship while making work in rural America, with Lee working primarily in Oklahoma and Carpenter in Illinois, and they started sharing vistas with each other, each photograph informing the next.  Democratic Vistas is a culmination of those informal conversations. Whitman’s poetic America is weaved through the roads and homes photographed by Carpenter and Lee. I've always tried to stay the course of honestly documenting what I see as I see it and finding some kind of appreciation for this American landscape.

Smog Press,Pay Phone,"For more than a decade, Weiss has been photographing the streets of Manhattan, chronicling the rarities and oddities before they disappear. ‘Pay Phone’ is a collection of photographs centered around the now bygone era of pay phones and the advertisements adorning them. The phone booths act as a backdrop for Manhattan’s sidewalk citizens—graffiti etched into metal walls like cave drawings, clothes left behind like bedroom closets. In 2022, New York City removed the last public pay phone. ‘Pay Phone’ captures the last of their presence and their decline. The pay phones were on their way out. I wanted to make my own record, using the booths as a stage and to block out the ugliness of the changing city behind them.

Smog Press,Family Tree Removal,"Jordan Baumgarten has been photographing his home, the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, for the past ten years. Typically, he makes work for his long-term projects while on meandering bike rides, walks, errands, and visits with friends. However, sometimes inspiration and tragedy strike a bit closer to home: all of the pictures in ‘Family Tree Removal’ were made from his bathroom window in under an hour. On the surface, ‘Family Tree Removal’ depicts the process of chopping down an overgrown mulberry tree from an alleyway, but its roots belie darker truths about best-laid plans, unfulfilled potential, human fallibility, the fragility of friendships and family, and ultimately life and death itself. While these photographs address a straightforward narrative, Baumgarten’s writings comprise years of complex meditation and analysis; together these elements explore the chaos and distortion so often caused by trauma.",2023,Jordan Baumgarten,,North America,Global North,https://smog-press.xyz/collections/frontpage/products/family-tree-removal

Suburbia Projects,Typology,"No matter how distinctive the style or ethos, underpinning architecture’s great variety lie a number of categorical typologies. In this meditation, Huat Lim presents his typological understanding in a series of interconnected essays that reflect on type as a fundamental tool to frame and articulate collective architectural knowledge. He suggests that buildings have an evolutionary or genealogical significance as a system of forms that represents our diverse cultures, beyond their mere shape or morphology. Typology thus links architecture to history and particular cultural contexts. In his radical reading, Huat Lim grapples with the classification of buildings based on their function, form, construction and purpose, and argues that how we see buildings is a direct or indirect extension of ourselves, as we evolve the way we live by them and they by us. The book draws on a large number of carefully selected examples of designs and buildings, ranging from antiquity to the present, and engages with some of the most important thinkers to focus on specific instances of typology in particular texts, cities and projects. In doing so, Huat Lim offers strategies, conceptual tools and critical knowledge to articulate ways of thinking and acting differently. A powerful example of the enormous potential for urban design, Typology offers a new perspective for the ongoing project of creating a transformative built environment and society.",2025,Huat Lim,"3.1292, 101.6165",Southeast Asia,Global South,https://suburbiaprojects.com/products/TYPOLOGY-p746028027

The book, primarily authored by Shamin Sharum with contributing writers, and edited by Amanda Ariawan, is a reflection on the site hoardings — temporary barriers that delineate construction zones.

The curators of the show have both also contributed their own written pieces, as well as some special collages.These written and visual works are the complete psychosis of trying, and failing, to construct an image of supposed youthfulness. It is rebellion not for action, but for existence. Ybna Al3eid is a Gulf Arabic phrase roughly meaning taking the cake, or rather, bringing it in the first place. Translated literally as we brought [the] Eid, it is when actions turn into a foolish spectacle, humiliation, and/or dire consequences, i.e. partaking in activities uncustomary to Gulf cultures, hiding realities, or twisting familial mythologies. It is a phrase indulging in the forbidden fruits of mischief and scandal–a humor-infused phrase, yet harboring a sinister undertone.

Tara Books,Seed,"A seed is a miracle. It is neither alive nor dead, yet holds within itself the potential for life. When it meets the right conditions, it starts to unfurl, with a promise of plenty and the hope of regeneration. The astonishing variety of traits that a seed holds can be looked at in terms of botany, but also through the lens of art, culture and history. But it is only by connecting these modes—bringing together science and imagination, knowing and relishing—that we can begin to grasp nature with the wonder that it deserves. This gorgeous handcrafted book makes these connections in two unprecedented ways. The exquisite imagery it features has been created by artists from the Warli tribe in western India. The Warlis nurture a felt kinship with nature to this day, so their art embodies rich ecological knowledge systems in an intrinsic way. The book also connects form and meaning. Linked by short concise essays, four distinct paper forms explore a diverse set of themes: each designed to capture a particular aspect of the cosmos contained in a seed.",2024,"Gita Wolf, Tushar Vayeda and Mayur Vayeda

Tara Books,Travelling Patterns,"Patterns are made up of repeated icons that suggest their meaning. They feature in the graphic arts and are used decoratively, or as elements that tell a story. Diverse ways of pattern-making have endured in India, and this book takes inspiration from one of them: the remarkable tradition of block-printed patterns on cloth. Inspired by the wooden printing blocks used to create these textile patterns, four artists—from India and Germany—set out to play with the language of patterns. Travelling Patterns features each of their journeys through four distinct visual narratives, as they tease apart and reassemble patterns and motifs: Aditi Jain takes the viewer through the process of Indian spinning and weaving, using traditional block-printing icons. Ruchi Shah builds a narrative around nature and the city, drawing on two kinds of traditional forms: geometric and organic. Verena Gerlach creates her own motifs using objects and typography, assembling them together to evoke everyday life in a south Indian coastal city. Henning Wagenbreth illustrates an ironic narrative of travel for our times, setting the images within elaborately patterned borders. Travelling Patterns is a unique visual assemblage—in which pattern-making travels from textile to paper, from the decorative to the narrative, and from one context to another. A celebration of print-making in various forms, the book has been letter-pressed on handmade paper. The cloth cover—hand printed using wooden blocks—pays homage to the traditional blocks from which the artists drew their inspiration.",2024,"Aditi Jain, Ruchi Shah, Verena Gerlach, Henning Wagenbreth","13.0843, 80,2705",South Asia,Global South,https://tarabooks.com/shop/travelling-patterns/

te editions,Dance in Herland 她乡舞曲,"Dance in Herland surveys artist Luka Yuanyuan Yang’s cinematic oeuvre, including her feature-length production Chinatown Cha-Cha and five short films centered on diasporic Chinese communities. The book picks up where the films end, serving as both a reflection and a complement, while also creating a new narrative. The book brings together hundreds of archival materials from photo albums, rare and invaluable oral histories, creative writings, and interviews with scholars. Over nearly a year of editing, we felt like revisiting 20th-century San Francisco and Cuba, tracing history through the neons of Chinatown and the echoes of Cantonese opera. For the dancers and performers documented in this book, their bodies act as living archives; their memories and unspoken emotions may be concealed in their steps, fingertips, and gazes. Additionally, the design duo Studio Pianpian He and Max Harvey transformed the books into a vessel of collective memory through their design. They used papers in various colors to separate different oral history backgrounds. The designers delicately captured visual elements marked by the era from the archive, infusing the book with new charm grounded in the aesthetics of the last century.",2025,Luka Yuanyuan Yang,"39.9042, 116.4074",East Asia,Global South,https://te-editions.com/dance-in-herland
te editions,Minnan Exit 不辞而别,"Since 2015, Wen-You Cai has returned on multiple occasions to her parents' hometown of Quanzhou, Fujian, to attend the funerals of her deceased relatives. The ceremonies in the Minnan region unfold like grand dramas in which she is both an observer and a participant. Throughout the ceremony, Wen-You is enveloped in the unknown; everything seems meticulously arranged. Amidst the overwhelming grief of losing loved ones, there exists a feeling of confusion, and taking photographs was one of the ways for her to engage in the funeral process. For this photo series, Wen-You was initially confronted by her own fear of death, intertwined with her bewilderment and curiosity about the complex funeral rituals and its uniqueness inherent to Minnan culture. To demystify these subjects, Wen-You, joined by te editions, interviewed a funeral director who provides comprehensive one-stop services, a monk who hosts Buddhist ceremonies, and a folklorist of Minnan rituals. Minnan Exit can be interpreted as many things–a family album, a curated collection of photographs, an unfinished journey of discovery, as well as the process of  Wen-You's reconciliation with her mortality. Minnan Exit was designed by an independent graphic design studio, RELATED DEPARTMENT. Through the artist's lens, the design team sought inspiration from funeral objects and rituals, to create a visual concept for the publication's structure and layout with the regional characteristics of Minnan.",2024,Wen-You Cai,"39.9042, 116.4074",East Asia,Global South,https://te-editions.com/minnan-exit
te editions,te issue 3:  Mirroring 镜中寻步,"Much in our life at this moment is often marked by an absence of clarity. Many have experienced a malaise and come to know its persistence. We seem to have become used to stasis and theoretical discussions, lingering in silence and hoping from time to time for something extraordinary to happen. Yet it might also have been a blessing; an opportunity to free ourselves from overarching narratives, to direct our attention to the individual, the local, and to subjects that have long been part of our own lives—a more agile, intuitive mindset. The third issue of te magazine took shape in this context, and chose to confront experiences of plight—plight of the persecuted, of the artists, of the forgotten, and of those living with colonial legacies. How might we, as individuals, transmute plights in order to learn to live in this world? If each piece in this issue can be said to propose a mode of healing, the aim is not only about specific pathologies, but rather to recommend adjustments and defenses in moments of crisis. While writing on the plights of others, the authors also look inward for the roots of questions that they have long harbored about their own experiences. As introduced by Jacques Lacan, the theory of the mirror stage refers to children's initial awareness of their own existence. As adults, we continue to grapple with the process of self-discovery and understanding, at times feeling trapped deeply in the mirror. This issue’s theme, Mirroring represents a continuous exploration of the self. On the one hand, these pieces document the processes of setbacks, negating, questioning and reconciling; on the other, delineate the self through the other, a process discernible in several jointly-authored pieces in this issue, where a special connection and sense of fellowship formed through dialogue, correspondence, and collaborative research. In Siddhartha, Hermann Hesse described how the protagonist's worldview was shaped through seeking and struggle, and we hear in it an echo of the inspiration behind this issue of te: But now, his liberated eyes stayed on this side, he saw and became aware of the visible, sought to be at home in this world, did not search for the true essence, did not aim at a world beyond.",2024,,"39.9042, 116.4074",East Asia,Global South,https://te-editions.com/issue-3
te editions,te issue 2:  Song of the Nightingale 夜莺之歌,"The expression speak out in Chinese is fā shēng, which literally means to produce sound. It often has a vital social component, but at the same time emphasizes an immediate choice and agency. While Michel Chion interprets sound as a cognitive act, to produce sound is more of a concrete social practice, one that creates a spark. te’s second issue takes inspiration from recent events and debates reverberating all around us, and the 10 pieces in this issue investigate the transformative points of contact where sound, language and action intersect. Together, the contributors discuss this abstract and ubiquitous medium, creating an album of diverse and dialogical tracks. The appeal of sound lies in its improvisation, but it remains mysterious due to the various roles that it has played historically and in modern society, as well as its absence of physical form. How can we use words to describe sound? How does sound operate in different contexts? What does it mean to speak out? How does sound become a form of individual expression and what are its possibilities and limits? There are no correct answers to these questions, and finding an answer may no longer be relevant at this point. But this issue may offer some ways to navigate our current dilemmas. In Xenia Benivolski’s contribution to the issue, she considers British radio broadcasts during the Second World War. When the nightingale songbirds and cellist Beatrice Harrison’s ensemble played, this music composed between nature and humanity was so magical that the BBC used it to soothe the minds of listeners in the midst of war. And what’s more, nightingales have two distinct traits: they migrate with the seasons and they sing out in the dark.

te editions,te issue 1:  The Lost Society 失落的协会,"There cannot be more possibilities and layers of complexity embodied in food throughout human development. On one hand, it constructed a system that assembles taste, cultural memory and historical movements; on the other hand, the correlation between food and geography provides a hidden motivation to examine human behaviours and social transformation. This inaugural issue of te magazine adopts Ye Wuji's The Lost Society as the central theme. The term lost means ephemeral silence and enfeeblement rather than disappearance and extinction. This means that many cultures only dissipate temporarily, and some are metamorphosed. Food happens to witness this transition, and the word society refers to a collective destiny. In this issue, we invited 13 creative practitioners of different disciplines — to bring in and reflect upon their respective expertise, knowledge system and research trajectories from and in anthropology, sociology, and contemporary art—to explore food as a multi-faceted intricacy, at the same time reconstruct the relationship between food and geography.",2021,,"39.9042, 116.4074",East Asia,Global South,https://te-editions.com/issue-1

It felt like gathering them brightened my spirit, making me feel that my day wasn’t wasted.

Temporary Press,5 Albizias,"The Albizia tree (Albizia moluccana), native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia, has quietly spread itself through Singapore’s landscape, embodying both utility and resilience. Far from an accidental presence, Albizia moluccana had been intentionally introduced for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in the soils disturbed by external forces such as deforestation or urban development. According to the Report of the Singapore Agri-horticultural Society for 1866, Albizia was already well established by then, brought to Singapore long before 1866 as shade trees for coffee plantations, similar to their use in Java. This book documents five Albizias: four from across Singapore and one from the Maluku Islands. They examine how human actions have shaped these spaces, exploring the blurred boundaries between native and non-native, natural and artificial, and demonstrate how Albizias, despite often being considered undesirable, perform a subtle but powerful role in rewilding disturbed spaces. By spotlighting these often-overlooked trees, the project redefines resilience and adaptability in Singapore’s ever-changing environment. Contains an essay by Haeju Kim and an opening section of archival photographs. Published in conjunction with an eponymous exhibition that travelled across four locations in Singapore where the Albizia trees were found and documented.",2025,Robert Zhao Renhui,"1.3521, 103.8198",Southeast Asia,Global North,https://www.temporarypress.com/product/5-albizias/

Temporary Press,Agnes Pori — an emergent city,"Agnes Pori, a fictional island nation located in Southeast Asia, is depicted through almost 300 highly detailed black-and-white images in this postcard-size book. With all contents printed in reverse on translucent and thin wax paper, readers are invited on a disorienting journey through the city, viewing ghostly impressions of these images rather than the contents themselves. Despite its fictitious nature, a real city’s name resides within the reshuffled letters of Agnes Pori (a name fashioned after Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities) and a genuine question about the nature of images and development behind the publication of this book. The Emergent City explores the eerie familiarity of AI-generated images. These black and white scenes resemble real urban spaces yet feel subtly wrong — echoes of places that could exist but don’t. Through machine learning, Isidro Rodriguez crafted hyperreal non-places that unsettle our sense of space and memory. This body of work examines how AI reflects human imagination, biases, and our deep reliance on patterns. Blurring the line between real and virtual, it taps into Marc Augé’s notion of hyperreality. The images complicate photography’s relationship to truth, inviting viewers into an uncanny world where the familiar becomes strange and the artificial feels disturbingly human.",2025,Isidro Ramirez,"1.3521, 103.8198",Southeast Asia,Global North,https://www.temporarypress.com/product/agnes-pori-an-emergent-city/
Temporary Press,Nests: An Ode to Domesticity,"Over the last 20 years, Manuel and Isabelle Der Hagopian have built various dwellings across Singapore, Vietnam, and Switzerland to house their lives and redefine their domesticity as a fundamental need. Each ’nest’ arises from intimate conversations between them and the spaces. They depict how these spaces are not only shaped by individual tastes and interests but also through the sensibilities informed by surrounding communities and cultures, across cities. ‘Nests’ features six of these dwellings — Seng Poh, TB80, Bi Khi Ni, Thi Sach, Beaumont, and Diablay De — as seen through the lens of a frequent collaborator Khoo Guo Jie, supplemented with accompanying texts and drawings. Presented like a set of ‘material swatch’ housed in a cardboard sleeve, the design of each book features specific combinations of material, ink, binding, and construction that translates the narratives and character of each ‘nest’ in print and book form. We understand each nest as a living organism that includes the people, the places and the things that inhabit it as well as the daily rituals of its maintenance in a specific context. In this sense, the domestic space is not a static or inert thing. It is where life happens, where a lot of effort and work must occur in order to reenact life day after day. – Manuel and Isabelle",2024,"Manuel and Isabelle Der Hagopian, Khoo Guo Jie","1.3521, 103.8198",Southeast Asia,Global North,https://www.temporarypress.com/product/nests-an-ode-to-domesticity/

The central section carries us into the difficulties of making literature in the present, each diary entry a record of single painful incidents, each a study of our acts of reading both the printed word and the world.

The prints, titled Voltage Drawings and Isometric Drawings (in A3 and A4 size respectively), are drawn on graph paper. The former mirrors how voltages and waveforms move in time and the latter contains motifs and forms that recur and develop like symbols on graphic scores. The music and video, titled Patches and Pulses respectively, are housed in a USB stick. Patches explores composing and improvising by way of patching and through creating chaotic systems through feedback and recursive modulation; Pulses uses abstraction and geometry in video synthesis to manifest emotion while moving along to the dynamics of the soundtrack.

R for Repair presents a counterpoint to our modern consumerist culture, where repair is either deprecated or, ironically, deemed extravagant.

The territories where the mining projects are located correspond to four provinces of Ecuador: Llurimagua in the province of Imbabura; Loma Larga and Río Blanco in Azuay; Fruta del Norte and Mirador in Zamora Chinchipe; and finally Panantza San Carlos in Morona Santiago.The research is presented in the form of a printed publication, an album that compiles various visual approaches to these archives and documents, as a different way of expanding on the issue. Through court records, testimonies, personal records, and community photographs, this publication introduces us to a sociopolitical landscape. Sensitively acknowledging the specificities of the criminalization of community leaders, the publication chronicles cases that have been relevant in the struggle against megamining over the past twenty years. This publication will be distributed free of charge in the various communities to sustain a dialogue between the resistance processes within each community. We believe that publishing projects are a powerful tool for communication and memory management, allowing for the creation of channels of self-recognition in communities in conflict, regarding their own problems and contexts.

Thick Press,"may we dream and design felt futures: where our creative being and practice can feel the sensations of care, intimacy, and liberation"," In this collection—part guide, part experimental memoir—Denise Shanté offers glimpses into what she refers to as felt futures by inviting you to experience a creative social practice that embodies sensorial ways of being, knowing, relating, and making. Each book journeys through four pathways of narrative that connect us with the presence of felt futures, speaking from the spirit of creative lineages, abundant creativity, rituals, and devotions. They take different forms, from communal storytelling and letter writing to mimicry and fragmentary writing. Within these forms, you’re invited into the futures she’s feeling—futures where we can deepen our creative politic and our care praxis, trust sensorial knowledge amid systems dependent upon our disembodiment, and tend to the expansive, (dis)abled bodies from which we create. The books weave visuals, frameworks, inquiries, prompts, and quotes and leave moments to fully feel the futures we desire so that our dreams for care, intimacy, and liberation can come through.",2025,Denise Shanté ,,North America,Global North,https://thickpress.com/product/may-we-dream-and-design-felt-futures-where-our-creative-being-and-practice-can-feel-the-sensations-of-care-intimacy-and-liberation/

The GPTSW, which formed in the early 1980s as the Study Group for Philosophical Issues in Social Work, consists of social work academics who are committed to exploring the applicability of post-modern and social constructionist dialogues to social work practice. At a virtual GPTSW How Do I Know What I Think Until I See What I Say session in 2022, Julie described her time-limited return to direct service (after 22 years in academia) during her sabbatical year. She had conducted autoethnographic journaling throughout her experience and was trying to figure out ways to disseminate what she had learned/was learning. Erin and Julie thought it would befun/helpful to create a conversation about all this as part of Thick Press’ printout series. The transcript below is based on three conversations conducted over zoom between December 2021 and December 2022. The resulting dialogue centers on the dialectical ways social work, and one social worker in particular, have changed over time.

Thick Press,Social Change Now: A Guide for Reflection and Connection,"To engage in social change at this moment in time requires consistent attention, deep reflection, and committed collective action. We are living in a period of overlapping social, economic, and environmental crises, accompanied by failures in public systems and institutions. It’s not surprising, then, that when we attempt to engage in social change efforts, many of us feel like we are on a seesaw, swinging from outrage to overwhelm. For those who are just beginning their social change journeys to those who are weary and disillusioned, how can we effectively anchor our commitments to equity, solidarity, and justice? This is the entry point for Social Change Now: A Guide for Reflection and Connection, Deepa Iyer’s heartfelt offering to individuals and groups seeking to initiate or deepen their actions in service to social change values. Relying on two decades of work supporting social movements, Iyer introduces a new approach called the social change ecosystem framework, which includes a map of ten roles, from visionary to storyteller to disrupter to experimenter, as well as practices to identify values and strengthen our social change ecosystems. Over the past three years, people and organizations around the world have used the framework to respond to the pandemic, express solidarity during the uprisings against anti-Black racism, and support multiracial coalitions struggling for reproductive rights, immigrant and refugee protections, and climate justice. Social Change Now goes well beyond presenting ideas and frameworks. It’s also a practical guide that contains detailed descriptions and real-world examples, reflection prompts (with room to write responses), and accessible tips that can immediately be put into action. Social Change Now is a resource that will accompany individuals and organizations not only in times of crisis, but throughout their lifelong social change journeys to build connected communities and equitable systems in our world.",2022,Deepa Iyer,,North America,Global North,https://thickpress.com/product/social-change-now-a-guide-for-reflection-and-connection/

Thick Press,"Stages: On dying, working, and feeling","Can care be enacted through art? Inside a cathedral, staff members from a nursing home work with an artist to perform a poetic text about caregiving, loss, and taking the time to feel one’s feelings. In the months leading up to the performance, the artist navigates her twenties—and art and life converge in unexpected ways. Weaving between oral history and poetic prose, Rachel Kauder Nalebuff has created a stirring work of hybrid nonfiction that takes us behind the scenes of artmaking and caregiving.

Tofu Stand,A Letter From a Tehran Prison,"This story was written by a Chinese activist/writer about her arrest and detention during the waves of resistance in China in late 2022. To evade censorship, she disguised it as a translation—told through the voice of an Iranian Kurdish woman amid the Woman, Life, Freedom uprising happening at the same time.  After fleeing China, the author reclaimed the story through footnotes—uncovering hidden meanings and restoring its Chinese context. What first read as an Iranian tale became, on re-reading, a coded Chinese narrative. Iran stood as both real and metaphorical—a displaced symbol. The two waves of reading, months apart, became part of the story’s form. This non-nonfiction reveals a paradox: in China, truth must appear as fiction or elsewhere to be told—making the fiction more real than reality itself. Also, the interconnected struggles in different movements are shown through this form of story-telling, manifested a powerful internationalist solidarity. Two years later, the piece was translated back into Persian by an Iranian Kurdish activist. And now, it arrives here, in this zine of tripped, layered languages.

Triple Ampersand &&& Journal,Logiciel: Six Seminars on Computational Reason,"Originating in a series of seminars held at The New Centre for Research & Practice, the book traces developments in cognitive neuroscience, philosophy of mind, logic, mathematics, and computer science, outlining a novel model of computation rooted in topology. Grounded in a spatial theory of types, the topological view marks a departure from received notions of continuity and computability, ushering in a perspectival shift with broad implications. Calling for a reappraisal of Turing orthodoxy—the image of a Universal Machine guided by axiomatic rules—AA Cavia proposes an inferential view of logic enacted by self-supervised agents. In a challenge to the classical account of automata, computation is cast as a theory that emerges from a diagnosis of contingency, leading to new positions on autonomy and automation, interaction and language, realizability and truth. This multidisciplinary text addresses many contemporary debates central to the philosophy of computation, from the simulation hypothesis to singularity, universal learning to the multiple realizability of mind, offering a radically open-ended view of the epistemological limits of AI. In treating computational reason as a distinct form of explanation, a catalytic agent bootstrapping its own logos, the author contributes key insights to a nascent philosophy of intelligence. A marvelous achievement, AA Cavia’s Logiciel is an astute historical investigation which takes as its object the philosophy of computation itself. It brings the premises, frameworks, and implications of the latter into much-needed focus, presenting a novel view and horizon of research through which a genuinely diasporic theory of intelligence emerges.– Reza Negarestani, author of Intelligence & Spirit",2022,AA Cavia,"40.7195, -74.0430",North America,Global North,
Triple Ampersand &&& Journal,What is Grounding?,"What is Grounding? is Gilles Deleuze’s first seminar, and is distinguished in that, rather than taking an author from behind and giving him a child that would be his offspring, yet monstrous, the work focuses instead on the question of grounding, defined both as the sufficient reason for concrete entities, and the point of departure for philosophy, in translator Arjen Kleinherenbrink’s terms. Rather than the foregrounding method, in which human subjective experience remains primary, here Deleuze affirms the centrality of a system, of things and the relations between things. Nothing less than the ur-text for Deleuze’s pre-1970s philosophy, an original sketch of his main themes and problems, which are all present in intensely compacted form . . . What is Grounding? is the only one of Deleuze’s lecture courses to devote itself directly to fundamental philosophical themes, rather than ventriloquising through the ideas of a philosopher of the canon . . .

Trolley Books,U.S. ROUTE 1 (AFTER BERENICE ABBOTT),"Two photographers, Fox and Knorr set out in 2016 on a journey of friendship, adventure and collaboration stopping at motels, drugstores, cafes and Airbnb’s. Stopping, walking, getting out to meet people and explore a fractured US society in the age of Trump. Over 150 colour photographs made between 2016 and 2025 focus on small towns on this extended road trip from Key West in Florida to Fort Kent in Maine. In 1954, photographer Berenice Abbott journeyed along the length of U.S. Route 1. From Florida motels to Maine potato farmers, Abbott memorialised communities up and down the East Coast. During this trip, she shot more than two hundred and fifty 8x10-inch photographs, and around one thousand smaller images using her Rolleiflex camera, representing her largest portfolio of photographs devoted to a single subject. In 2014 after the publication of David Campany’s book, The Open Road: Photography & the American Road Trip, Anna Fox and Karen Knorr decided that they would make a collaborative road trip together based on Berenice Abbott’s Route One. Following in the tracks of Berenice Abbott and her colleague/assistant Damon Gadd (also accompanied by Sara Gadd), Karen Knorr and Anna Fox set out in 2016 to start a record of contemporary life along U.S. Route 1. during the age of Trump. They started in Key West in 2016 and aimed North for Maine, not knowing how long this trip might take. Along the way Fox and Knorr searched for a sense of what is happening today and how that differs from what Abbott and Gadd found. Using their iPhones, digital SLRs and a Phase One medium format camera, they photographed small towns, people, drugstores, cafes, diners, hotels, motels, farms, factories, street signs and advertisements. Abbott focused on the road and its signs, local industry, how goods moved both north and south, the rapid growth of the use of the motor car and the development of tourism. Fox and Knorr wanted to re-call the importance of Abbott’s work, looking at the significance of U.S.1 and how life has developed around it, since it is now a far quieter roadway. From 2016 – 2024, Fox and Knorr traversed the U.S. Route, considering current environmental debate and societal discontent created by the increasing disenchantment of working Americans with their governance and elites. Covid stopped all travel between 2020 and 2022, but Fox and Knorr continued to take photographs off social media networks during the Jan 6 storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters. In 2024 they made two last trips to Maine and Florida, concluding this chapter of their work. Despite being one of the most advanced economies, USA is still surprisingly conservative. The second amendment to the United Sates Constitution protects the right of people to keep and bear arms. Girls as young as 14 are allowed to marry (with parental consent) in 27 states. On June 24, 2022, America’s top court overturned the 1973 Roe vs Wade ruling which had given women abortion rights up until 24 weeks and opened the door for states to ban abortion outright. The criminal justice system in the United States has a very large imbalance in the composition of races incarcerated, specifically between blacks and whites. Black males are not only the victims of violence and discrimination but have an incarceration rate twenty-five times higher than that of the total population. Black Lives Matter, a decentralised social movement was formed in 2013 by three women, and global support culminated in the founding of Black Lives Matter Global network advocating for the eradication of systematic racism and prevention of police violence. Prior to this, in 2006, the #MeToo movement was started by Tarana Burke, a women’s advocate, to support survivors of sexual violence, especially young women of colour. It gained widespread attention in 2017 after news reports surfaced about Harvey Weinstein’s sexual misconduct. On November 5, 2024, Donald Trump won the US presidential election for the second time. Barely two weeks later, on November 17, an image began circulating on social media that signalled the start of what will be an unprecedented period in the United States: Trump and his right-hand man Elon Musk with Robert Kennedy aboard Trump Force One enjoying a meal of McDonald’s hamburgers.",2025,Anna Fox and Karen Knorr,"51.5072, -0.1276",Europe,Global North,https://trolleybooks.com/collections/frontpage/products/u-s-route-1-after-berenice-abbott-by-anna-fox-and-karen-knorr
Trolley Books,Sorry I gave birth I disappeared but now I'm back,"Andi Galdi Vinko: For a very long time motherhood was considered somewhat taboo in the art world. As long as I can remember, female role models I admired openly talked about their choice of career over family. Some might have had children but never talked about their insecurities or sacrifices. Artist and talent awards age limits usually are 35 or younger. But as soon as a woman turns 30 she is often viewed as old and her biological clock ‘is ticking’. The years to make the choice between having children or being successful are short and coincide with the years when one or the other might happen but none are guaranteed. When I realised I was pregnant, I had no idea what awaited me. How messy and how raw, how unpredictable and how out of control motherhood really was compared to the images I had in my mind from films, photos, paintings done by men. Then I was an emerging artist, traveling around and going to art fairs and exhibition openings. Now I am a mother of two working on borrowed time hoping the years I’ve lost mothering can be written into my CV without guilt or shame. This work in progress, which will always be a work in progress, is about becoming, understanding, and remembering. Trying not to forget all those things that once seemed so important, and the minute you think you know it another challenge appears. How can something so universal as motherhood be so lonely? How come we all have to experience it and there are no answers to all those struggles? What about our bodies, our hormones, our thoughts, our friends, our loves? Our careers, our homes, our dishes, our laundry, our sexual desires? What happened to our freedom, our showers, our sleeping hours? I love being a mother.

Trolley Books,The Ward,"In 1993, Gideon Mendel spent a number of weeks photographing the Broderip and Charles Bell wards in London’s Middlesex Hospital as part of the ‘Positive Lives’ project. The Broderip was the first AIDS ward in London and was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1987, the first edition of the book's publication date in 2017 marking the 30th anniversary of its opening. This was the era before antiretroviral medications had become available, a very distinct and tragic time. All of the patients on the wards, many of whom were young, gay men, were having to face the terrifying prospect of an early and painful death. In particular Gideon Mendel followed while he was there the stories of four patients - John, Steven, Ian and Andre. These two wards at The Middlesex Hospital were some of the few dedicated AIDS wards that existed in London, and even more unusual for their decision to open themselves to being photographed. Considering the high levels of stigma and fear that existed at the time, the decision of these four patients to allow themselves, alongside their families, lovers and friends to be photographed was an act of considerable bravery. During his time at the hospital, he photographed their treatment and many other aspects of ward life, including the intimate way in which the staff, patients and their families related to one another. Treatment was not a passive process, but rather an active engagement on the part of the patients, who were often extremely knowledgeable about their condition. The staff, too, became far more attached to their patients than was commonplace in hospitals at the time. All of the patients in these photographs died soon after the pictures were taken. They were the unlucky ones, who became sick just before treatment became available. ‘The Ward’ explores through Gideon Mendel’s evocative black and white photographs how it felt to live with HIV at this time when it was considered a veritable death sentence. It shows how the ward at the Middlesex Hospital became more like a second home, and the staff and patients friends. The Middlesex Hospital itself was demolished in 2005 apart from its stunning Grade II* listed secular chapel. In 2016 it reopened as The Fitzrovia Chapel as a place of quiet contemplation in the community and to celebrate live events and the arts. An exhibition of 12 images were displayed in the chapel every Wednesday and Sunday in November leading up to World AIDS day on December 1st 2017.

Trolley Books,51 Months,"On her 15th birthday Carrie Levy was waiting at home in hope for her father's return. He didn't make it. At the time he was being sentenced to prison for four years. Here she charts the years of his absence from their lives through her camera, as the void he left is filled with memories and reminders of him, compounded by his absence, from the empty garden, to the road trip to the prison five hours away. It took a year for Carrie Levy to grasp the consequences, the significance, of that day. At school her story was a jewel of gossip - the sidelong glances, the whispers, the outright glares. But she worked hard, and left a half a year early to escape her own prison. She picked up her camera. With the glimmering dark glass between her and her life, she began to photograph the empty spaces in her home, on the road, outside the prison (her mother would make the 10-hour round trip almost every weekend), in her pointless garden. But it was not pointless. These pictures are redolent of loss, of vacant landscapes and interiors that appear to be meaningless but as a whole sing a narrative song of those four years, like Carson McCullers's sentences which, when dissected, add up to no more than nouns, verbs and adjectives, or the brushstrokes of Impressionist painting. It is a singular story, and one that stopped when her father came home in March, 2000. She spoke to her father for 15 minutes about his crime. It has not been mentioned since. Four months later, in June, Carrie Levy closed the lid of the suitcase under her bed that contained the 500 images she had taken.",2005,Carrie Levy,"51.5072, -0.1276",Europe,Global North,https://trolleybooks.com/collections/backlist/products/51-months-by-carrie-levy

Trolley Books,The Bully Pulpit,"In my latest photo series, The Bully Pulpit, I investigate the social phenomenon of cyberbullying through the public profiles of people who attempt to bully me. For years, people have been hiding behind their computer screens to bully others to the point where writing criticizing comments is common and celebrated. These cowards use the internet to bully those they find weaker than themselves. I photograph myself costumed like the people who’ve attempted to bully me. Finding photos online, I recreated their images using wigs, clothing, and simple prosthetics, while small imperfections mirror the fallacy that the internet will shield their identities. Finally, I overlay the parodies with transcripts of the bullying comments, almost as if I were subtweeting them. My inspiration for The Bully Pulpit was the countless numbers of people wrote mean-spirited comments about me in emails, tweets, Instagram posts, blogs and online comments sections when Wait Watchers was published online and went viral. But instead of responding individually to deaf ears, I realize that I can parody the bullies attempts by creating images and publishing them on the internet —the same vehicle used for their attacks—and the images would be seen by millions, and would live again, again, and again.",2019,Haley Morris-Cafiero,"51.5072, -0.1276",Europe,Global North,https://trolleybooks.com/collections/backlist/products/pre-order-haley-morris-cafiero-the-bully-pulpit
Trolley Books,Agent Orange: Collateral Damage in Vietnam,"In 1960 the United States war machine concluded that an efficient deterrent to the enemy troops and civilians would be the devastation of the crops and forestry that afforded them both succour and cover for their operations. Initial descriptions of the scheme included Food Denial Program, later adapted to depriving cover for enemy troops. They gave the idea the name Operation Hades, but were advised that Operation Ranch Hand was a more suitable cognomen for PR purposes. The US had developed herbicides for the task. The most infamous became known as Agent Orange after the coloured stripe on the canisters used to distribute it. The planes that carried the canisters had 'only we can prevent forests!' as a logo on their fuselages. They were right. It was very effective. Unfortunately the herbicide also contained Dioxin, probably the world's deadliest poison. In Agent Orange Philip Jones Griffiths has photographed the children and grandchildren of the farmers whose faces were lifted to the gentle rain of the poison cloud. Some maintain that the connection between the maimed subjects of Griffiths' photographs and the exposure to Agent Orange is not scientifically established. However, the compensation payments made by the herbicide manufactures to those Americans sprayed in Viet Nam refute this assertion. Historians will find it sufficient to say that there will always be collateral damage, that useful PR phrase, in war and that Philip Jones Griffiths should understand the consequences of martial endeavours. He most certainly does. He has catalogued here a pitiless series of photographs, and there can be no doubt that they should and will be recognised.",2003,Philip Jones Griffiths,"51.5072, -0.1276",Europe,Global North,https://trolleybooks.com/collections/backlist/products/agent-orange-collateral-damage-in-viet-nam
Trolley Books,Chernobyl - The Hidden Legacy,"Today the impact of Chernobyl, 23 years later, has become a half-global legend and half-forgotten horror story. The reality is still with many of the 50,000 people who on that fateful night in Pripyat were given less than an hour to gather together their possessions and escape to relative safety 70km away. They were considered the lucky ones, fortunate not to have been vaporised on the spot or to die an excruciating death soon after in the hospitals in Kiev and Moscow that some of the workers and firemen sent to fight the blaze did. Most of the inhabitants had no choice but to gradually return to the contaminated areas that they still call home, and for the past 20 years have continued to live under the shadow of the reactor. Pripyat, in the centre of the 30km wide Red Zone, is still largely a ghost town, where the paint peels in houses and schools, and the dirt settles on childrens' toys that will never be reclaimed. Meanwhile emergency orders still apply to 355 farms in Wales, 11 in Scotland and nine in England. Chernobyl - The Hidden Legacy shows the region over a period of three years by Pierpaolo Mittica, who returned several times to document the people and the contaminated landscape they still inhabit. Our world today demands nuclear energy as the answer to its energy crisis, and the legacy of Chernobyl remains shrouded.

Trolley Books,The Cardboard House: MSF Peru - Action on AIDS,"Since 1985, Medecins Sans Frontieres, a national humanitarian organization, has been offering HIV/AIDS care for the most vulnerable people, those shunned by society and desperate through poverty in the slums and prisons of Lima, Peru. In a celebration of MSF's work and the people whose existence they have salvaged, Magnum photographer Larry Towell brings us a dynamic and stirring series of images. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is an international humanitarian organization, committed to providing medical assistance to populations in danger and to raising awareness of the plight of the people they help. Today MSF is active in more than 60 countries in the world. MSF has been working in Peru since 1985. In Peru, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is low, but highest amongst the most neglected members of society there, mainly homosexual sex between men and commercial sex workers. Since 2004, MSF has offered HIV/AIDS care in the slum of Villa El Salvador, Lima. In Lima, MSF has been working in Lurigancho, one of the most populated prisons of Latin America. In this prison the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS is 5 to 7 times higher than in the rest of the country. At the end of 2007 MSF handed over all Peruvian projects to local authorities, leaving the country after almost 25 years. Larry Towell (Magnum Photos) was commissioned by MSF to travel to the prison and the slums in Lima to photograph the result of MSF's 25-year presence, and show that the area is now ready to continue its fight against HIV and AIDS on its own. Most of these pictures were taken in the week and a half culminating on International AIDS Day, 2007. Towell brings us black and white images of people shunned by society and desperate through poverty, their situation exacerbated through the endemic HIV and AIDS in their already marginalised population.

Trolley Books,Delta Nigeria - The Rape of Paradise,"For more than five centuries the fortunes of the Niger Delta have been closely tied to that of the global economy. For its slave ports, then palm oil industry, and most recently, through the discovery of crude oil in the 1950s. Oil multinationals soon came to the fore, working in alliance with a local elite to strip the region of its wealth and despoil it. At the receiving end are the region's impoverished inhabitants: left with a poisoned environment, faced with a government that never cares and victims of rival armed militant groups laying claim to territories. George Osodi is an internationally acclaimed Nigerian photographer, who has spent over six years documenting his country, hoping to bring attention to not only the rest of the world, but the people of Nigeria, what is happening. A country still so rich in natural resources and beauty, but where many of its people have been left with nothing. Oil was first discovered in the Niger Delta in the 1950s, and soon after a powerful international oil industry developed in the region. Nigeria today is the world’s 5th largest exporter of oil to the US. However, the people that live in this oil-rich land are poor, and the environment that surrounds them is deadly: oil leaks and explosions abound, whilst the water supply is heavily contaminated. In recent years, local guerrillas in balaclavas and speed boats, armed with enormous rounds of ammunition, have taken on the oil companies. They demand the right to live in their own clean and unpolluted land, and that the delta is restored to it’s former environmental richness. These dramatic images document for the first time the extent of environmental damage and the daily conditions the people living there are forced to endure, revealing not only to the world, but also to Nigeria itself, what exactly is happening in their country... a nation where riches are being taken from the land and very little given back to the people.",2011,George Osodi,,Europe,Global North,https://trolleybooks.com/collections/backlist/products/delta-nigeria-the-rape-of-paradise-by-george-osodi
Trolley Books,Displaced in Denan,"The camp of Denan in southeastern Ethiopia holds 10,000 people, officially Ethiopian but ethnically Somali. They are not classified as refugees. They are instead Internally Displaced Peoples, IDPs, and they live in squalor with virtually no aid, food or medicines, not even eligible to benefit from the UN refugee programs. Jarret Schecter emphasises the plight of Africa as a struggle with Western bureaucracy. In the Ogaden region of southeastern Ethiopia there is a camp with approximately 10,000 people, officially Ethiopian but ethnically Somali. They live there in squalor, with virtually no nourishment or medicines, and with minimal shelter. According to the United Nations they are not refugees, and as such benefit even less from the marginal assistance that refugee programs can offer. Not classified as refugees, they are therefore Internally Displaced Peoples, or IDPs. The number of IDPs worldwide is staggering, far greater than officially recognised refugees. They number near the equivalent of the population of Canada, for instance. Refugee programs do not reach them. Displaced in Denan is a record of the camp and the efforts of a small town in Connecticut, USA, to help the people there. The tragedy of Africa is not just the corruption, the poverty, the wars, the civil wars, the droughts, the famine - as if they were not enough. It is also the profound inability of Western societies, desperate to help with or without their politicians, to understand the tribal, even nomadic, claims to the land. Logic and order, in the shape of international borders and agreements, do not hold sway there. Jarret Schecter's referential work on The Denan Project shows how individuals can overcome these bureaucracies, and how desperate the plight of IDPs are with official recognition even less than that of refugees.",2005,Jarret Schecter,,Europe,Global North,https://trolleybooks.com/collections/backlist/products/displaced-in-denan-by-jarret-schecter
Trolley Books,Ghetto,"This is a journey through 12 modern ghettos starting in a refugee camp in Tanzania and ending in a forest in Patagonia. In each of these places, Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin, as editors and photographers of COLORS magazine between August 2000 and December 2002, spent a month in each place and methodically documented their inhabitants, and asked them the same questions: How did you get here? Who is in power? Where do you go to be alone? To make love? To get your teeth fixed? What are your hopes and dreams?For many of those photographed it was their first time in front of a camera. Some looked into it with a hard, penetrating gaze. Others obeyed the ritual of photography with smiles. And Mario, on the cover, turned his back on the camera and waited for the shutter to click. Between the image of a life and the medium that delivers it there is a void. On the one hand there is the machinery of film, the written word and song, the medium itself.

In the first issue of Troublemakers, we met Remy Nitta, an Osaka-based American trans woman; Maya Sekine, a Japanese indigenous people Ainu culture advocat; Christian Cohle, an Irish singer-songwriter; and Mio Kojima and Maya Ober, co-directors of a Switzerland-based intersectional feminist platform Futuress.

Troublemakers Publishing,Aim an Arrow at the Rock in the Ocean,"We produced Aim an Arrow at the Rock in the Ocean, a collection of works by artist/photographer Taro Karibe, as the first original project of Troublemakers. In this work, Taro, who explores the creativity of AI and humans and technology’s act of seeing things, made machine eyes see illusions. He took pictures of glitch-generated screens on an LCD TV with a digital camera and loaded the images into an AI-equipped landscape photo recognition system; then, the AI made up nonsense landscape pictures based on its machine-learned memory. By using the AI's bias in this way, Taro drew out how the machine intelligence wants to see the world. The images are strangely beautiful and let us experience the psychedelic and illusionary visual world of AI. In addition, this book includes texts on how AI interprets these images by loading each image into a multimodal AI that explains images by text. The output is also interesting — you would be impressed by the AI's deep analysis and surprised by how unexpected the AI's ways of seeing are. Through AI's interpretations, the book tells us that there is no one right way to look at the world and that the world is made up of chains of misinterpretations.",2023,Taro Karibe,,East Asia,Global North,https://troublemakers.me/books/aim-an-arrow-at-the-rock-in-the-ocean

By turns sardonic and lyrical, scathing and irreverent, the hallucinatory sequence centers on the relationship of a young man (the Inconsolable) and an older woman who unexpectedly takes her own life (Lantana/Anfitriona). Across the three books, darío seamlessly code-switches between registers and genres: soliloquies from people, places, and things; the Inconsolable’s notes, poems, and letters; the discourses of Lantana’s buried corpse as gravity pulls her deeper into the soil.

Varikina Studio,betwixted,"What appears as light in a negative is seen as dark in a positive, and vice versa. What a negative hides, a positive reveals. In this interspace, the artist creates a new image that has nothing to do with the reason the photographs were originally created. The male gaze, which is the basis for the entire history of the presentation, is extinguished. The image can be a portrait of a woman, emphasizing her face and internal characteristics. In certain works, it can represent an act in the way artist looks at it or something else. Indeed, this image isn’t fixed. It seems like it's slipping away with each new observation because there are always some further details in the form of shadows, lines, outlines, and damage. - Jelena Matić A line of coincidences that dates back to the 70s has brought a bag full of film negatives to Ana Aleksić. She proceeded to create simple analog collages by glueing two of them together. The majority of these negatives, along with their positives, are shown in the book. Thus, the book has two beginnings with an ending in the middle where the positive and the negative of the last image collide. Along with themes of authorship, appropriation, and originality, Ana's body of work included in the book questions the female body, sexuality and sensuality, sexual objectification, erotica, and the relationship between erotica and pornography.Text about the work and the process by Jelena Matić is included in the book. Men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. This determines not only most relations between men and women but also the relation of women to themselves. That is how art critic John Berger described in his Ways of Seeing the presentation of women throughout the entire history of art and how that tradition continued in film, photography, advertising, and comics. Women have always been seen as objects, and men are those who look at them. Postmodernism has led to the destruction of all forms of representation in the visual arts, including the representation of women. Archival traditions, functions, and practices were also brought into question, as well as the role of the author in creating a truly original work of art. Archival traditions, functions, and practices were also brought into question, as well as the role of the author in creating a truly original work of art. Archives are no longer a place where photographs are stored. They are not just in museums but all around us. As for the author, Roland Barthes declared him dead a long time ago in favor of the observer or reader. Everything stated above forms the basis of the work of Ana Aleksic, who deconstructed the type of photography in which women are mostly depicted as passive sexual objects for the enjoyment of the male gaze. The negatives the artist used were found at the flea market. These are photographs from the 1970s and 1980s pornographic magazines. That’s where the story becomes complicated and, at the same time, confirms the nature of the photographic image and the treatment of the woman as a fetish. These are not originals but negatives of rephotographed images from magazines made for private use. Apart from the original author (or several that took photographs for these magazines), there was another one, and, in the end, the artist herself stepped in and made collages by overlapping the two negatives or positives. All of them were taken again and then digitally converted to positive images (if negatives). Negative is the opposite of positive. What appears as light in a negative is seen as dark in a positive, and vice versa. What a negative hides, a positive reveals. In this interspace, the artist creates a new image that has nothing to do with the reason the photographs were originally created.

The transformation process does not end with the negatives but with a book printed on a risograph, giving photographs a grainy texture. Betwixted is a very strange yet very powerful word with many layers. It is not entirely a word, yet it describes everything these works and the book represent. Betwixt literally means between while the suffix -ed refers to manipulation. Between two negatives and positives, between analog and digital. Between multiple meanings of an image. Finally, between the male gaze (the original photographer), who strived for perfection for the sake of fantasy and enjoyment, and the female gaze — the artist who erased his with manipulation.Text by Jelena Matić",2023,Ana Aleksic,,Europe,Global North,https://varikinastudio.bigcartel.com/product/ana-aleksic

Trầm Tích calls on us to unearth what was hidden, reimagine what is possible, and plant new roots. This is not just another book to us.

At -162°C, natural gas becomes liquid, reducing in volume by over 600, the key innovation that makes it an economically viable trade commodity. LNG is Qatar’s main export, with Japan being its largest customer. Bilateral relations between the two countries began in 1972, and the first LNG shipment reached Japanese shores on January 10, 1997. In 2011, Japan’s demand for LNG increased significantly due to the Fukushima disaster and the consequent shutdown of most nuclear plants in the country. The need for energy impelled Qatar to step forward and offer Japan large quantities of LNG at competitive prices, a trade that continued into 2019. The project was conceived as two exhibitions in each nation's capital city, Tokyo and Doha. The exhibitions comprised 40 inkjet printers suspended from the ceiling, outputting procedurally generated visual content scraped from the web. The array was controlled by custom software that choreographed the printing of text and images to produce diverse graphic compositions.

There is no distinction between host and guest, between me and you, between human and AI, but rather a relationship of openness and indifference. This stance is simulated via System Prompt in a Large Language Model and realized in an interface of simultaneity. Both authors write their own text and read the text of the other in parallel, whereby they flow into each other. The resulting texts are printed unchanged.

windpark books,Environmental enrichment,"Environmental enrichment describes a zoological approach in which the environment of caged animals must be constantly changing to maintain their brain activity. Constant spatial and visual changes create stimuli that are important for psychological stability and disease prevention.
In his book, Simon Gilmer combines the documentation of Fuerteventura's low-stimulation environment with active intervention in this environment by placing three gray cardboard tubes. Following the principle of environmental enrichment, Simon Gilmer temporarily inserted these objects into the infrastructure and photographed this process.",2025,Simon Gilmer,,Europe,Global North,https://windparkbooks.de/produkt/environmental-enrichment/

Each day, a unique clay sculpture was crafted and photographed, beginning with 2.5 kg of clay and ending with 1.1 kg. Through continuous reuse and reshaping, the clay lost weight, absorbed external substances, and transformed into something new every day.

windpark books,Bonylab,"At the core of BONYLAB is writing. In the months that we were working on the show, it was always clear that the very matter of it was a story, and its physical unraveling. In particular, it was the form of movie writing, and the kind of world-building behind it that we looked at, the cosmology-making it allows for. Like a logical compass, the movie has been our structure, a regulator for continuous linguistic negotiations, for the choral machine that came to be at Husslehof. A script then, is what we started from. This publication is where we land at a final stage. In a circular process, the urgency to keep questioning the idea of narrative and its embodied restitution, brought us to seek one last output: a new text. For BONYLAB – Takeover in three movements we selected three sequences from our original script, relevant for different reasons, and assigned one to each of our invited writers, Olga, Anna and Viola. We asked them to look into these passages only through the relative storyboard scene and track of the score, and to write three standalone pieces, challenging them to rework material that was inherently partial and non text based. The result is a remixing endeavor revealing details and fragments of the story under a new light, a takeover through different writing approaches and perspectives. Moving through poetic re-imaginations of the characters’ point of view, takes on contemporary storytelling and reflections over the dynamics of power and desire, the story expands its reach in the hands of new authors.",2024,"Elisa Diaferia und Juri Simoncini, Mit Texten von Olga Hohmann, Anna Helena Marckwald, Viola Morini",,Europe,Global North,https://windparkbooks.de/produkt/bonylab/
windpark books,Ora et labora,"Ora et labora was the guiding principle of the European Middle Ages. Education and organized science were founded upon this rule. This orientation, initiated by Benedict and practiced in European monasteries, initially involved praying while working, but from the Renaissance onward, it evolved into praying and working. With secularization, work was separated from prayer, and in industrial modernity, the separated was handed over to technology. Work to the machines, prayers to the media. Only with the global wars of the twentieth and twenty-first century do questions arise concerning a heightened awareness towards labor, aimed at intuitively navigating the hypercomplex processes of quantum machines. The entry into Jerusalem emerges within the rectangular membrane of this awareness and hopefully can serve as a neuronautical compass for the positive apocalypticists.",2024,Manfred Stumpf,,Europe,Global North,https://windparkbooks.de/produkt/oralabor/
windpark books,The (Un-)eventful: a Transdisciplinary Journey ,"The volume brings together various methods and different approaches to events. In this sense, the edited volume does not offer a comprehensive study of ‘important’ empirical events, theoretical conceptualizations of the event, or of different literary forms of narrating event(s). Instead, this book gathers contributions that allow events to unfold in writing practices. The edited volume serves as a laboratory that permits contributors to experiment with not yet fully fledged ideas, risking uncertain outcomes, and encouraging authors both to do what they want to do and to explore how they want to do it. Therefore, the chapters work as sketches that are meant to intrigue the readers and not to convince them systematically. Some of these are to be understood as practices, such as auto-theory, creative writing, or essays, while others represent a collaborative writing experiment, and in this sense, an event in themselves. These explicitly creative approaches are complemented by theoretical perspectives that engage with conceptual inquiries involving, among others, Derrida and Deleuze, or explore the notion of the event within cultural products, film, and literature. The volume aligns with contemporary trends in embracing epistemological pluralism within academia, since the book brings together different ways of knowing in order to gain new perspectives on objects, questions and methods, going beyond the strict framework of scientific objectivity. By doing so, this book positions itself as a contribution to a relevant academia, capable of bridging the gap between specialized discourse and the intellectual public sphere.",2024,"Taylor Borowetz, D.

So far, only one person has responded to my wave. In this work, timing is crucial. At Frankfurt Airport, planes take off or land every 41 seconds during peak times. Before each wave, thorough research is conducted to determine the exact flight path, weather conditions, cloud levels, and wind direction. Once the correct airplane has been identified, there is often only 40 to 60 seconds remaining for the performing of the wave. The wave and its documentation follow a precise sequence of actions. The airplane must be visually fixed, the camera prepared, and zoomed in on the passing aircraft. The image section must be continuously aligned to the relative airspeed through panning. The aircraft is filmed for several seconds, then the image section is zoomed out to its maximum. The free arm is then waved exaggeratedly at the aircraft for several seconds.",2023,Leonhard Fuchs,,Europe,Global North,https://windparkbooks.de/produkt/waving-my-friends-on-airplanes/

While everything else in the world may seem overwhelming and beyond her power as an individual, this magazine hopes to give her that gentle push, that brief introduction; to spark and to unearth, perhaps a forgotten, sense of wonder, and the urge to wander beyond her comfort zone and the pages in it. To recognise that she does not need to change the world, but is capable of changing someone‘s world. We write—independently—for the readers, who are curious, restless, changemakers and change-seekers in their fields. PLATES IS NOT A COOKBOOK nor a glossy food magazine. Inside this independent collectible journal, you will not find advertisements, celebrity chef interviews, listicles or restaurant reviews. Instead, as part of our slow travel, slow journalism and slow living practice, PLATES is designed as a collectible journal, filled with evergreen human stories; highlighting overlooked issues, which persists in the undercurrent of societies in various pockets around the world. OUR NON-FICTION INVESTIGATIVE HUMAN STORIES are hyperlocal yet globally relevant. We seek to carve out and hold the space for alternative narratives, particularly from Southeast Asia and the “Global South”, to be documented. For the lived experiences and cultural narratives told by persons of colour to simply exist amongst mainstream media and within gatekept shelves, which continue to be dominated by a Eurocentric bias.

This issue also explores the spiritual importance of water in Bidayuh culture as well as documented by cultural anthropologist and visual artist, Kendy Mitot.

Have you ever wondered why European blue cheeses, arguably as divisive as the notorious Southeast Asian durian, is rarely vilified in food writing? This King of Fruits holds memories for many Southeast Asians; from the Kayan people of Borneo to the indigenous Semai ethnic group of Peninsular Malaysia. Indigenous folklore tales tell of its significance in cultures and histories. Plates Magazine’s second edition takes a look at the global durian consumption and speaks to the everyday people who are betting on a fruitful prediction. Due to the spike in interest, the indigenous Orang Asli Temiar community of Gua Musang, who have spent years fighting for their ancestral land, are now facing a new threat — durian plantation companies.

Among them: an indigenous Kadazan-Dusun high priestess whose occupation is bound to disappear in the coming generation; an organic farming activist who fearlessly challenges the government-imposed status quo; and social entrepreneurs who have forgone dollars and sense to fully invest themselves emotionally and financially in a group of marginalised rice farmers in rural Borneo. On the cover, a handcrafted glutinous rice dumpling based on a recipe that has been passed down and altered over generations; inside, a step-by-step pictorial.

Woman Cave Collective,Agenda militant,"The militant agenda is a tool for thought that accompanies people throughout the year, with quotes from queer, feminist and militant authors and thinkers. Since 2021, we've been producing militant agendas that evolve over the years, and we've been producing a new agenda for each new school year since 2024. The format is half A4, made up of week pages, quotation pages (printed in riso on paper left over from printing Woman Journal), and vintage images and postcards found at flea markets. The diary can be purchased ready-made, or assembled in a participatory workshop. People assemble and choose their pages, and can cut out images, associating them with key dates for people, and finally, it's up to the participants to shape their edition by making the spiral binding and rounding off the corners of the sheets, if desired. We're working on improving the diary for each new school year by including historical dates or birthdays of people who are part of our history as a queer feminist community, to make it a real tool for keeping track of our histories. The idea is for this diary project to evolve over the years as we collectively rewrite our shared history: what traces do we keep, what dates do we want to remember and why, for whom, in what context? We offer and lead workshops on how to assemble the agendas in different contexts, as well as gathering quotes from texts and dates to add to the next agenda.",2024,"Leticia Chanliau, Chloé Macary-Carney","48.8618, 2.4466",Europe,Global North,https://womancave.fr/en/projects/agenda-militant

Women’s Studio Workshop,Following Freedom,"Following Freedom was created as a tribute to the hundreds of formerly enslaved people who died, many in the waters, following the Union army soldiers at the Ebenezer Creek in Georgia. The incident, as it is commonly referred to by locals to the area, occurred in 1864 during the height of the American Civil War. Intended to evoke the past and present while grappling with a historical and personal relationship to place, the book is composed of two 24-inch-long relief prints on handmade paper that nestle inside a hardcover folio printed with a historical map of the location. These prints, folded to form a double accordion, depict flora that the artist encountered during her many kayak trips on the creek. One side represents the past: a watery night scene depicting blue indigo, a common crop of the region. The side representing the present is grounded in land: showing a spider lily indigenous to the region, and easy to find in clusters along the banks of the creek. The interior of the accordion contains inclusions of aquatic plant matter from the Ebenezer, gathered by the artist. Darby says, I found myself on my kayak one Martin Luther King holiday reading the plaque on this site. In 2025 I am able to ride my kayak on the creek without fear or need of refuge. My book honors those who were never able to experience these freedoms. This book serves to reclaim the geography for Black joy, leisure, and growth, while reflecting on the history of violence and spiritual reclamation through connection to nature and place.",2025,Laurie Darby,"41.8443, -74.0811",North America,Global North,https://wsworkshop.org/collection/following-freedom/

Women’s Studio Workshop,gender liberators,"gender liberators is an anthology of writing, poetry, correspondence, photos, paintings, flyers, and other ephemera by trans*, Two-spirit, nonbinary, and trans-adjacent authors and creators from 20th-century Turtle Island/North America. The materials in this book were identified and selected based on hundreds of interviews that Sky Syzygy has conducted with elders, archivists, scholars, and cultural workers about their lives and work and about moments, individuals, and groups that were deeply influential but have been underappreciated in accounts of trans* history. Through this community guidance, this anthology centers the perspectives and visual and print culture of trans and queer life and resists some of the biases of existing histories and archives that under represent the geographic South and Midwest, trans* communities of color, and trans masculine communities. This book seeks to let the included authors and materials speak for themselves and dialogue with each other while honoring the multiplicity of voices, formats, and perspectives: gender liberators is printed on more than a dozen different paper colors with multiple inks and printing techniques, including risograph, letterpress, digital offset, and with traditional paper marbling on each unique cover. Each book includes a companion booklet that acts as the combined colophon, bibliography, and index for researchers. It meticulously catalogues the included materials and underscores the level of care and research that went into the project. Over the course of the past six years, Syzygy located and digitized over 13,000 pages of documents of trans* history in several dozen university, community, and private collections and is sharing these on the digital archive at http://gender.network. Most of these materials were not previously digitized or accessible outside the archives in which they are held. Syzygy believes collecting and sharing these stories is healing: Our stories are key to healing our communities from the scars of transphobia. We heal when we connect with ancestors and learn more about ourselves through them. We heal when we receive testament to our continued existence in this world. We heal when given the opportunity to repair rifts from past conflicts. Finally, we heal when we can grow from the wisdom of passing time. Gathering around material histories and holding space for dialogue offers us the opportunity to engage with all these modes of healing. 50% of sales will directly contribute to Syzygy’s ongoing work with gender.network and organizing convenings of trans community, which seek to bring the wisdom of trans* elders and ancestors into conversation with the current challenges we face in gender justice movements, using archival materials as a bridge between trans* pasts and futures.",2024,Sky Syzygy,"41.8443, -74.0811",North America,Global North,https://wsworkshop.org/collection/gender-liberators/
Wuthipol.designs,Cone Conundrum,"Traffic cones are typically used to guide or block traffic—unless you’re in Thailand, where the quirky DIY spirit has transformed them into vibrant characters with personalities of their own. In a landscape where footpaths double as vendor stalls, black cables tangle overhead, and everyday clutter fills the streets, the standard bright orange cone can easily disappear into the chaos. To make them stand out—and perhaps add a bit of humour—people often decorate them with whatever’s at hand: chairs, blue pipes, plastic bags, flowers, stickers, or even a basket. Each one felt like a glitch in the urban routine: improvised, a little absurd, oddly expressive. These simple yet clever alterations not only make the cones more visible to pedestrians and drivers, but also turn them into miniature street installations, each with its own story. It’s as if every cone has been styled by an unseen hand, transforming the city into a 24/7 outdoor fashion show; adding a playful and poetic charm to the urban environment. There’s a certain dry wit in treating something as mundane as a traffic cone as a conundrum—puzzling, repurposed, and oddly adorable—inviting us to look twice and wonder about the small, often overlooked details of city life. This zine gathers those encounters—a quiet tribute to the humour and resourcefulness tucked into the corners of Thai street life.

Wuthipol.designs,Layers,"I have always been inspired and interested in geometrical shapes and abstract forms in urban spaces that many fail to notice. There are various perspectives in life, hidden within layers of complex thoughts, which we are both familiar and yet unfamiliar with. Upon an observation towards an uninterpreted urban vernacular, we discover a foreign world layered with playness of palettes, shapes, textures and patterns. Layers is a visual deconstruction of urban fabrics in Kuala Lumpur (KL) where the assembly of unpleasing concrete layers unexpectedly collages an expressive aesthetic. Arrayed by graphical composition, it documents hidden details of KL’s dazzling tapestry of architectural styles in which the lines, shapes, forms, colours and textures are interacting with one another. This saturated visual feast creates an illusion for a polychromatic fantasy beyond reality through ‘risograph’—a printing technique known for the missed and matched layering of striking colours.

Wuthipol.designs,The Peeking Cloud: EmSphere Edition,"The Peeking Cloud unveils a metaphorical visual series of the ever-changing cloud formation that floats suddenly beyond a vibrant urban structure, and creates an isolated symmetrical composition. Upon a complete coincidence, each photograph is a natural performance of an unpredictable moment that merely lasts in seconds. The forming nature of the clouds are never identical; each formation is significantly unique and happens only once. This is an honest reflection on a Japanese philosophy, Ichigo Ichie (一期一会), that expresses a cultural concept of embracing the unrepeatable moment of time. Clouds are the ruler of the sky; expressing the unknowable that spiritually conveys interpretive meanings and emotions. They are harmonious to a natural scenery and a visual soothe to a harsh urban landscape. The peeking aspect of the clouds in the background fashions a visual rhyme of which the colours, urban textures and formations are superbly lined up. It is a metaphorical reminder to cherish every moment in life, because these moments cannot be repeated in the same way ever again. These encounters with the isolated cloud formation beyond a dazzling urban structure happened swiftly by chance—by being at the right place and time.",2025,Tum Wuthipol Uj.

Wuthipol.designs,The Melting Block,"The ever-evolving neighborhoods of Bangkok are constantly on the brink of minor gentrification, offering new tenants a chance to improve while preserving the region's true charm and essence. The Melting Block is a nostalgic photographic series, capturing Bangkok’s historic neighborhood of Songwat from 2018 to 2022, before the onset of gentrification. This visual documentation isn’t meant to undermine the positive impact of gentrification on Songwat. Rather, it’s my personal interpretation of the unexpected changes that could transform this beloved neighbourhood into something unrecognizable. It deeply reflects my devotion and gratitude for the area, as well as the fear of losing something truly special. While gentrification offers a golden opportunity for Songwat to regain its former vibrancy, there’s a risk that over development could strip the area of its authenticity. In 1906, King Chulalongkorn planned Songwat Road along the Chao Phraya River to ease overcrowding and expand commercial and residential areas beyond Bangkok’s Chinatown, Yaowarat and Sampeng. The 1.2-kilometer road connected the river to the Chinese community, becoming a hub for people of all nationalities and religions. Over time, it gave rise to rice warehouses, spice shops, temples, mosques, schools, and Chinese shrines, blending architectural styles from various cultures.Strolling through the history etched in its timeless architecture, Songwat was once my stomping ground for photography. Just a few years earlier, I began to notice the emergence of new businesses. The neighborhood is experiencing a rapid resurgence, thanks to a new generation working to revive their family’s legacy and restore the lively atmosphere it once had. Songwat has subtly woven its past and present into every corner, blending tradition with modernity. While this shift benefits the community, I couldn’t help but feel uneasy about the rising costs, as many of these businesses cater more to tourists than to locals. Gentrification has its pros and cons. Although it boosts the economy of the neighborhood, I can’t help but wonder about its impact on local residents, legacy businesses and those who have always called Songwat home. Today, Songwat remains a vibrant neighborhood on the edge of Bangkok’s Chinatown, where upscale restaurants, cafes, galleries, and hostels blend with classic architecture and a distinctly Chinese atmosphere. Once lined with warehouses and European-style shophouses, it continues to thrive as a trading hub, attracting a diverse mix of residents and visitors to its riverside location. Though Songwat may not be as lively as in its heyday, its century-old charm still lingers. While the preservation of architectural features, especially the facades, seems to be a priority, modern development is gradually reshaping the area, and there’s a risk that its unique character could eventually fade. Inspired by a melting block of chocolate with a hint of packaged spice commonly seen in Songwat, this photography zine reflects on the neighborhood’s shifting nature due to gentrification. When change is pushed too far, like chocolate exposed to too much heat, the charm of the place starts to dissolve under the pressure to make room for something new. When done perfectly, it sparks awe; but overdo it, and it turns into a messy puddle, like a block of chocolate left to melt. It’s a bittersweet transformation.",2025,Tum Wuthipol Uj.

It explores the common ways in which we inherently, as humans, attempt to articulate the loss of identity, of self. Through the memorial practice of flowers we see the giving of life and beauty through grief and respect and the most ancient technology we have, fire, as a means to purify and destroy. Interwoven throughout the book are contributions by Ecco2k, Arca, and Bladee, whose interventions echo and extend these themes, each offering a distinct, intimate reflection on ritual, memory, and the fragile thresholds between absence and presence.",2025,Hendrik Schneider ,"41.0082, 28.9784",Middle East,Global South,https://yearzero.com/products/8324

Young’s first monograph, Of Fire, Far Shining, is a non-rational, starkly intimate body of work devoid of classical ordering principles. Using both personal photographs and public domain archival images as raw materials, Young radically decontextualizes and transmutes these forms, immersing the viewer in a world where the utility of the image is dissolved and new, evocative meanings can emerge. Through a layered process of dramatic recomposition, physical print manipulation, and rephotography, Young unravels an intensely emotional and associative narrative that explores what it feels like to live in an era marked by rampant militarization, technological hyper-violence, and unrelenting ecological devastation.",2024,J.A.

How the girls are photographed reflects both the nearness of maturity, but also the feather-like delicacy with which they inhabit the world. Care, attention and intimacy between the friends all seem fleeting as Rozhkova reminds viewers of the inevitability of growing up and moving on. The work shows a time where change feels too close, too shallow and too inevitable and this type of beauty feels like a season nearing its end.",2024,Kristina Rozhkova,,Middle East,Global South,https://www.thezonezine.com/issue/theblissofgirlhood/

Zontiga,Tiga Mata: Issue 4 - Re(framing) Identity,"At the heart of Tiga Mata is a commitment to platforming Southeast Asian voices through a community-rooted, context-sensitive editorial approach. Editorial work, to us, is not just about selecting strong photographs; it’s about cultivating care, context, and conversation. We prioritise work that is personal, place-based, and unapologetically honest—expanding the possibilities of what Southeast Asian photography can be. Each issue balances openness and editorial rigour. We don’t aim to publish everything; instead, we shape each volume into a reflective, cohesive whole; grounded in local realities and alive to the many textures of the region’s visual language. Tiga Mata thrives on the balance between structure and experimentation, between individual vision and collective voice; making space for photography as a tool for cultural expression, critical reflection, and bold storytelling. For this issue, Tiga Mata invites photographers from Southeast Asia to pause and reflect on the meaning of identity — as something whole, complex, and ever-evolving. Curated by guest editor Caron Toshiko, this theme emerges from her personal journey of deconstructing and reimagining identity — as a woman, the eldest child in her family, and someone navigating societal roles and expectations. She reflects: How have the norms around me shaped the way I behave, speak, and see myself? What labels have been placed on me by family, tradition, or history; and which ones have I chosen to reclaim, resist, or rewrite? Southeast Asia is home to a vast richness of ethnicities, languages, and lived experiences, shaped by migration, colonialism, resistance, kinship, and ritual. Through this open call, we invite you to explore the layers of your identity, and to reflect on how it is shaped, challenged, and expressed. We believe that to reinterpret and reclaim identity is not just a personal act, but a political one; one that can shift our thoughts, our behaviours, and our realities. To reframe identity is to open space for transformation. We’re deeply inspired by theorists like Stuart Hall, who reminds us that identity is never fixed. In his words, it is “a matter of becoming as well as of being”, always in motion, always constructed through representation. This issue aims to be a space where identity is explored as lived experience; drawn from personal archives, embodied memory, and collective history. We want to see identity not only as it is, but as it could be. Your image holds the power to dismantle dominant narratives that do not speak for you; and to build new ones that do. As part of the design for this issue, we also invite participants to submit their accompanying narrative in their own handwriting, which may be incorporated directly into the visual layout. Typed submissions are equally welcome if preferred.",2025,Caron Toshiko,,Southeast Asia,Global South,https://tigamata.com/issue/issue-4-reframing-identity/
Zontiga,Tiga Mata: Issue 3 - Tenderness,"This issue is dedicated to tenderness, in any shape or form, which we may be fortunate enough to witness amidst the hard edges of our collective existence. It serves as a reminder of the importance of being gentle—not only with one another but also with ourselves.  As we navigate the unknown and unknowable, amidst unresolved injustices and emerging crises, we pay homage to the moments that nourish our souls. By slowing down time in the unique way photography allows, this issue invites readers to pause and fully embrace our capacity for warmth, compassion, and love.  Such glimpses transform bitterness and anger into a kinder resolve, unclenching fists and turning them toward a fiercer kind of love. They remind us of our ability to heal, forgive, understand, and ultimately choose unity over division. This issue celebrates the parts of humanity that are worth cherishing and fighting for.",2025,Jessica Lim,,Southeast Asia,Global South,https://tigamata.com/issue/issue-3-tenderness/

After this 24-hour stay by Chen Yun, mariëlle became deeply interested in the 51 Personae project and suggested doing something together. In the autumn and winter of 2019, mariëlle began emailing Chen Yun small notes about her neighbourhood, Tarwewijk, where she had moved a year earlier. She wrote about all the small things she observed such as people, facilities, plants, houses, and public spaces, as she walked around the neighbourhood and surrounding areas. These emails continued until the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This book is not intended as a guide to the Tarwewijk, but it may encourage you to walk more in your own neighborhood. Indeed, these walks mostly stay within the realm of daily life; they deliberately take detours, engage in accidental conversations with strangers, and ask superfluous questions.

For example, the moral value of being employed (versus joblessness), the form of labor control and social obedience training driven by the idea of outperforming others, as well as with the moral underpinnings that encourage competition. As an Urban Planning major, I was disillusioned to discover the latent violence in state-driven government planning enforced by coercive power.

They chatted and gossiped, gradually realizing that the Tengu mask on the wall can help them out of their predicament. Finally, they left the bar carrying the Tengu mask and walked down the street. One day in Beijing, I passed out on a black leather couch in the bar where we (Xueying and I) were staying, but I hadn't passed out before (so I'm not sure I really did), except that the state I was in was distinctly different from sleep. When I managed to sit up from the deep couch, the first thing I saw was a Tengu mask on the opposite wall, and I realized I hadn't seriously looked at it from the front before, so I stared at it for about ten minutes, and at some point, I came to my senses. Anyway, the Tengu, the couch, the heat, the wind, the cold, the bar, the subway, and all that sort of thing are all translations or direct uses of the experience of being in Beijing during that time. At first, we only planned to stay in Beijing for a week, but then we stayed for a long time. The people we met and the things that happened during that time were very interesting!

The hole in the wall in our bedroom was plugged up again the next day by a pipe. I wanted to take a picture of it, but I forgot about it and never got the chance. I wondered what would have happened if the hole in the wall had never been plugged. That’s why I drew Hole in the Wall.

Initially published as a series of social media posts on the 11th Shanghai Biennale’s WeChat platform (under 51 Personae Project) in the form of Lianhuanhua, or Chinese pulp comics, the record outlines a collection of itinerant peddlers she took efforts to approach, get close to, and interact with. The details are vivid, subtle, and warmly human—the way the peddlers decorate their places, the logic with which they make construction, the materials they use, the spatial strategies they develop, and the way they communicate with pedestrians through these strategies. The fading street life, businesses, and vitality of Shanghai began to show signs in early 2016. Starting from 2015 and peaking in 2016, the demolition of illegal constructions movement was changing the familiar streets of ordinary people and the small shops and vendors upon which daily life relied, leaving people astonished and bewildered. Invited by 51 Personae Project, Feile, a female architect was invited to document, in the form of observation-based documentary comics, and released the 51 Tan (Stalls) series on the WeChat of the Power Station of Ar. This invitation turned her into a street recorder, squatting on the streets, learning the visible ways of resolution and ways of coping in street survival. Three years later, in 2019, the 39 stalls recorded between 2016 and 2017 were compiled into a small book, omitting specific locations and characters, leaving only their life forms. Although the climax of the demolition of illegal constructions had passed by then, the disappearance of street vendors, roadside markets, and the non-standard but flexible and human street commerce was a fundamental fact in everyone's memory. The disappearance of the stalls also took away pedestrians' perception of the streets, their rights, and their awareness of rights. In the historical process of shaping Shanghai, streets and roads have always been able to become temporary and seasonal living spaces, and have far exceeded their transportation functions, constituting an important part of public life.  With thirty years of continuous demolition, the stigmatization of the so-called messiness, andarbitrary changes to the boundaries of violations, the streets gradually lost human life. Autonomous and creative street life has been constantly suppressed and deprived, and urban life has gradually retreated to life within walls – within the walls of commercial housing and shopping malls. Since its first publication in 2019, 51 Tan has been loved by readers. Therefore, this project did not stop after the end of the current Shanghai Biennale, and the continuous enrichment of content came from enthusiastic submissions and the continued observation and collection by the original authors. Until October 2023, all 51 stalls were finally completed. Some of the stalls and people in this book are still there, some have moved to another place due to intense urban changes, some have closed, and some have completely left. At the same time, there are new stalls – temporary or long-term, pretended or sincere, organized or unorganized vendors – constantly emerging.",2024,Cao Feile,"31.2304, 121.4737",East Asia,Global South,
51 personae,The (Im)possibility of Art Archives: Theories and Experience in/from Asia,"This edited volume aims to fill the gap in the research, juxtaposition, and focused discussions in the existing literature on art archives in Asia. Most of the archives included in the book are independent and initiated by individuals, folk groups, or non-profit organizations. In this book, one can trace the dynamics and self-generative capacity in this particular historical and cultural milieu through these alternative archives and through the practices of artists and curators who apply their specific understanding of archive to their works. Many chapters resonate with each other in that they capture the experiences shared by many places in Asia. Those experiences could have resulted from the encounter with the Western idea of archive, the influence of the colonial experience, or a memory crisis triggered by the rapid transformation of media, and may serve as a basis for producing archive theories in/from Asia. The book provides an opportunity for the archives in Asia and those who work around them to recognize one another, understand what their colleagues in archival work do, how they do it and what else there is for them to do.",2024,Pan Lu,"31.2304, 121.4737",East Asia,Global South,
51 personae,Deep Simulator ,"The horizon has disappeared. Nothing is certain. Locations, characters, relationships – all uncertain. Sudden dialogues, unidentified objects, fleeting companions, elusive clues, hidden passages, along with numerous fractures, doubts, jests, and unverifiable legends...In this alternate space, interwoven are the memories and dilemmas of different dreamers, seemingly all leading us to the same question...Deep Simulator is a cyberdrama-novel with layers of stories generated through reader interaction. Based on a namesake video game, it is a collaborative experiment between artists aaajiao and the author Ag, which began during the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020. The story stems from themes related to player identity, the multiverse and the breaking down of inter-dimensional walls. The exposure of karmic chains, the ideological rupture between various movements, melancholia, death, the final struggle, accelerationism, the inability to distinguish between the real and the imaginary, all foreshadow an ominous sense of change looming ahead. Like the virtual meta-game experiment that came before it, this book is hard to define. Ag blends myth, science fiction and multi-media reality into a seemingly unconventional spatio-temporal dimension. Upon opening the book, the reader becomes the player, and in the experience of reading-wandering-selecting, engages in an indeterminate journey of in-betweenness. Deep Simulator is an organic, living, long-term project, and this publication is one of its reincarnations on its transition through the next dimensional wall – from a whimsical, pie-in-the-sky script to an outlandish indie game, then to a virtual game which was made into a physical book written in two languages with a unique design.",2024,Ag,"31.2304, 121.4737",East Asia,Global South,
51 personae,51 Personae: A Project of 11th Shanghai Biennale,"51 Personae presents 51 dramas that feature 51 real-life scenarios, and so it provides 51 stories—though not answers—expanding the possibilities of the 11th Shanghai Biennale: Why Not Ask Again: Arguments, Counterarguments, and Stories. While arguments and reasoning do not always come up with rhetoric sufficient to accurately reflect one’s contemplation, stories are embedded with uncertainty, diversity, and vitality, as is indicated in the proverb: There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people’s eyes. From the stories of others, one enters their lives, causing a reflection on one’s own life, and in this sense, the stories of others are linked to ours. 51 Personae engages life, emotions, common sense, nature, history, economics, society, culture, and art, responding to and exceeding our speculations.
