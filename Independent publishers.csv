Our ultimate goal for this project is to create a brick and mortar community space where people can access the necessary tools and support networks to create their own works and host artist talks and other events.

Bored Wolves,"Bored Wolves is an independent publisher run by poet Stefan Lorenzutti and Joanna Osiewicz-Lorenzutti, based in Kraków and the Polish Highlands. We are dedicated to publishing poet’s books, artist’s books, zines, and comix (many of our books blend and overlap these categories) in carefully crafted but always affordable editions. Working with authors, artists, and graphic designers across borders and languages, mediums and disciplines, we are committed to the individuality of each title, and curious about the patterns and echoes that emerge between them. Stefan began Bored Wolves in 2010–11, in collaboration with Joanna, as a book-at-a-time imprint for publishing his poems in a way that felt true to himself. Every step of the way, his Pole Star has been the organically driven DIY ethos of the Mimeo Revolution, a limitless source of inspiration. In September 2020, Bored Wolves pivoted toward publishing other poets and artists, beginning with Sevinç Çalhanoğlu’s My Life in Curves Recently, a zine of hand-drawn marker graphs. With the publication of ten titles, 2021 was the year Bored Wolves became quantitatively not-micro. Going forward, we remain qualitatively committed to immersing ourselves in each project with the same concentration, dedication, and affection as in years past when we were publishing that one single book at a time. All Bored Wolves books are printed offset in Kraków, Poland on fibrous Arctic Munken paper. Bindings are sewn & glued to facilitate cracking of spines. While we are haptically committed to printing the best book we can without ever compromising on paper, binding, etc., a central plank of our publishing philosophy is that our books should always be affordable. And as the question often comes up, know that the wolves aren’t actually bored at all. They were kind of bored a decade ago, but not anymore, because they started making books.",2010,"Kraków, Poland",Europe,"50.0647, 19.9450",https://www.boredwolves.com/

Chimurenga,"Chimurenga, a pan African platform of writing, art and politics founded by Ntone Edjabe in 2002.

Outputs include a journal of culture, art and politics of the same name (Chimurenga Magazine); a quarterly broadsheet called The Chronic; the Chimurenga Library – an ongoing invention into knowledge production and the archive that seeks to re-imagine the library; the African Cities Reader – a biennial publication of urban life, Africa-style; and the Pan African Space Station (PASS) – an online radio station and pop-up studio. The aim of these activities is not just to produce new knowledge, but rather to express the intensities of our world, to capture those forces and to take action. This has required a stretching of the boundaries, for unless we push form and content beyond what exists, then we merely reproduce the original form – the colonized form, if you will. It requires not only a new set of questions, but its own set of tools; new practices and methodologies that allow us to engage the lines of flight, of fragility, the precariousness, as well as joy, creativity and beauty that defines contemporary African life.",2002,"Cape Town, South Africa",Africa,"-33.9221, 18.4231",https://chimurengachronic.co.za/

Fraglich Publishing,"Fraglich Publishing was founded by Austrian photographer and researcher Lukas Birk in 2007 with the aim of producing zines and localized publications aligned with his research. Since 2017, we have also been publishing books and editions by other artists and researchers. This broader focus on publications has further expanded in recent years. We produce and distribute the publications of the Myanmar Photo Archive, the first photo book publishing endeavour to come out of Myanmar. All books are locally made with whatever materials are available. We also train people in the art of book making. Our books primarily concern photographic history with a rarely seen cultural insight. This is why we made it our aim to produce and distribute the books locally before selling them abroad. For example, the books from the Myanmar Photo Archive are produced in Yangon, sold locally for an adapted price so that people can afford them, and only then distributed internationally on this platform. Hence, purchasing a Myanmar Photo Archive book also supports the development of the Myanmar photo book scene. We believe change is needed in the way we give access to information, even if this means taking a cut in profits and creating complications in our production. As book and edition making collides with our belief in reducing the consumption of natural resources, for each book we sell we plant a tree with The Eden Project. Ps: If you are wondering what ‘Fraglich’ means, it translates as ‘questionable’ in German. We produce books with historic content, yet we do not believe in rigid forms of history; that’s why we put our own books into question.",2007,Myanmar,Southeast Asia,"21.9162, 95.9560",https://www.fraglich.com/

Gato Negro Ediciones,"Since 2013, Gato Negro Ediciones has acted as a recognizably-urgent voice in independent publishing across the cultural realm. Advocating the liberty of thought, the Mexico City-based press intentionally prints titles that challenge the so-often sequestered view of contemporary society. In a new world where temporary excess and obstruction of knowledge are lived at its height, Gato Negro returns the voices of their authors to the fundamental purpose of the book. By remaining inside the economically-amicable yet unconstrained process that is risograph printing, an archive of over 220 titles has been successfully called into life ever since its inception. From political manifests to art theory and prose, the books of Gato Negro do not wish to deconstruct reality through ornamental distractions that lately seem to have become an inevitable requisite within the modern history of publishing. Instead, Gato Negro embraces the deliberately-chosen content in its most primal form: straightforward and entire. And therefore, ever-growing in context. The outcome of each publication is a dialogue between reader and creator — an ecological construction of selfhood that distills collective contemplation while all we do is live.",2013,"Mexico City, Mexico",Latin America,"19.4326, -99.1332",https://www.gatonegro.ninja/

Incendium Radical Library Press,"Incendium Radical Library Press is an independant publisher run out of the library. The press prioritises critical and experience-based perspectives of the world, and attemps to center marginalised voices. The press is founded with a belief in the transformative potential of reading and writing with community. IRL is a collectively run independent community space and infoshop. We are an eclectic mix of people from diverse backgrounds, experiences and interests but we all believe that what is happening in our lives and all around us needs to be challenged. We want to create a space where we can make connections with other people and find ways to do this. We live on stolen land, in a place where Indigenous ways of knowing and living are constantly attacked. Many First Nations peoples are living in poverty, many children are taken from their families and police harassment and violence for some people is a common experience. The waiting list for public housing is ridiculous, community housing barely exists, rent is rising constantly, leases are insecure and short and homelessness is increasing. People are imprisoned indefinitely by the Australian government for trying to find safety here. Trauma and mental health affect many people, and suicide is too common. Family violence happens across all communities at astonishing rates and many women (particularly trans women and First Nations women) and children are hurt by those closest to them. The oceans are filling up with plastic, the western grasslands of Victoria are being destroyed by urban sprawl and animals and plants are going extinct. The world is heating up in a scary way. Many of us spend so much time working, doing things that mean very little to us until we can't even imagine what it is we would actually want to be doing. For some of us it's hard to meet people and easy to feel isolated and alone. These are just some of the things that affect us in deep and different ways. We don't have answers, sometimes everything feels overwhelming and it's hard to know what to do. However we want to create a space where people can learn, challenge and disrupt the systems that maintain oppression and imagine other possibilities for how the world could be. We are interested in learning through stories of people and communities, from various theories, from perspectives based on histories that explore self-determination, collective care and organising. We hope to create networks of solidarity and support people experiencing and resisting oppression. We hope that at IRL, people will come together, organise and run things themselves. We want the space to be used to discuss ideas, challenge each other and our understandings of ourselves and the world, learn through these experiences, and share skills and thoughts but also be a place to meet people, have fun, relax, laugh, hang out, and do things that are exciting.

The journal is especially interested in discussing the invisible labor, politics, and challenges attached to practices that are vulnerable due to their ephemeral nature, institutional neglect, cultural bias, or politically unpopular content.  For each issue, TIA invites a different writer who explores the work of a person/collective of their choice. The journal offers two volumes - Vol. Los Angeles and Vol. Berlin -  and the issues are published in limited edition prints at irregular intervals through close collaborations between the artists, writers, editors, peer reviewers, and advisors. The journal presents a community-led archive, which relies on the shared information and collaboration of its contributors.

State propaganda. Zines no one kept. Footage no one wanted. Pictures pulled from your uncle’s porn stash. What slipped through, what rotted, what refuses to die. Khajistan saves it all.

We buy from and work with hoarders, collectors, exiles, the politically silenced, the religiously condemned, the gendered and erased.

Libri Finti Clandestini,"Libri Finti Clandestini is a cosmopolitan artistic collective formed by artists El Pacino, Aniv Delarev and Yghor Kowalvsky that bases its work and research on the artist's book. Founded in Rome in the summer of 2012 and subsequently established in Milan in the following years, the Libri Finti Clandestini project was born with the aim of creating real books using only “ found paper ”, the kind of paper that people normally consider rubbish. By exploiting materials with the most heterogeneous pedigree possible (coming from abandoned factories around Europe, libraries, warehouses, paper mills, archives and printing laboratories…), the project began with the creation of books and sketchbooks patiently assembled one by one, hand-bound, stamped, numbered and entrusted to illustrators, printers and artists to be “completed” or offered to an audience that could decide their fate: ready to be written on, drawn on or to take on whatever meaning the owner wishes to give them. Subsequently, production also focused on the production of  single-copy books and small pop-up editions , whose bizarre characters from the late 19th/early 20th century imagination move and come to life when the pages are opened. The main feature of the project is the creation process with (almost) zero impact on the environment , thus investigating and experimenting in the field of recycling and degrowth. By dedicating much time and attention to researching materials for their reuse with the aim of hand-producing drawable supports, over the years the LFC project has expanded into other artistic directions, beyond the editorial one, always in the name of experimentation, investigating the fields of photography, urban exploration and letterpress , collaborating with 5X Letterpress since the beginning of 2018.",2012,"Milan, Italy",Europe,"45.4685, 9.1824",https://librifinticlandestini.bigcartel.com/

Max Pinckers,"Max Pinckers (1988, BE) grew up in Indonesia, India, Australia and Singapore, and is currently based in Brussels, where he was born. His work challenges the conventions of documentary photography by exploring theatricality, performativity and collaboration within documentary and photojournalism, made visible through the explicit use of cinematic lighting and staging in a documentary context. Photography, for Pinckers, is a speculative gesture that involves more than the mere representation of external realities. His approach to reality and truth is plural and malleable, open to articulation in different ways. Like the external world that it claims to represent, the documentary image is inherently unstable, dependent on context and the customary visual language of realism. Pinckers’ work draws on contemporary and historical debates, merging fact, fiction and imagination to reflect on the ways that our shared realisms are defined and represented through photographs. It treats documentary as a hybrid practice involving not just images, but objects, performances, texts, found footage and sculptural interventions that investigate the complex nature of representation. Collaboration is essential to Pinckers’ practice, creating a space for the exchange of ideas between himself and the people he works with, and for the critical examination of his own position as a photographer. Ultimately, Pinckers’ self-reflexive work sets out to question both documentary discourse and artistic practice—to create other modes of documentary that foreground the deceptive nature of images yet always emotionally and empathically engage with people and their stories. Max Pinckers’ work explores the critical, technological, and ideological structures that surround the production and consumption of documentary images. Documentary photography, for Pinckers, involves more than the representation of an external reality: it’s a speculative process that approaches reality and truth as plural, malleable notions open to articulation in different ways.",,"Brussels, Belgium",Europe,"50.8477, 4.3572",https://www.maxpinckers.be/

Thick Press,"Thick Press is a collaboration between two old friends, a social worker (Erin Segal) and a graphic designer (Julie Cho). Inspired by utopian organizations and feminist presses, we decided to start a publishing practice organized around collaboration and care. (Both of us felt frustrated by the ways capitalism infuses design and social work practice.) We wanted to make highly visual books that account for the complexities of doing care work in the context of late capitalism and interlocking forms of oppression. We publish zine-like booklets as well as heftier titles that we distribute from our website and through Small Press Distribution. Care-givers, justice-seekers, and community-builders often find ourselves in the thick of human experience. Yet so many of the texts we produce rely on the thin logic of Western medicine and mainstream social science! What might happen if we grounded more texts in the arts? In critical theories? In spirituality? In lived experience? What might happen if we paid more attention to medium, form, and design? We aspire to a practice that is loving, reflexive, playful, and collaborative. We worry about reproducing oppressive structures, but we’re not really that interested in critique. Above all, we want to make unusual books with others. Inspired by artists’ books and zines, Thick Press publishes books that cross genres and disciplines. All our books relate to working or living in the thick of human experience.",,"Washington DC, US",North America,"38.9072, -77.0369",https://thickpress.com/
